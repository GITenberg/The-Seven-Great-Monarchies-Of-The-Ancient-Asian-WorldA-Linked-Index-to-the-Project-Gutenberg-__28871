    CHAPTER VII. CHRONOLOGY AND HISTORY.
</h2>
<p>
"I saw the man pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so
that no beast might stand before him, neither was there any that could
deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became
great."&mdash;Daniel, viii. 4.
</p>
<p>
The history of the Persian Empire dates from the conquest of Astyages by
Cyrus, and therefore commences with the year B.C. 558. But the present
inquiry must be carried considerably further back, since in this, as
in most other cases, the Empire grew up out of a previously existing
monarchy. Darius Hystaspis reckons that there had been eight Persians
kings of his race previously to himself; and though it is no doubt
possible that some of the earlier names may be fictitious, yet we can
scarcely suppose that he was deceived, or that he wished to deceive, as
to the fact that long anterior to his own reign, or that of his elder
contemporary, Cyrus, Persia had been a monarchy, governed by a line of
princes of the same clan, or family, with himself. It is our business in
this place, before entering upon the brilliant period of the Empire, to
cast a retrospective glance over the earlier ages of obscurity, and
to collect therefrom such scattered notices as are to be found of the
Persians and their princes or kings before they suddenly attracted
the general attention of the civilized world by their astonishing
achievements under the great Cyrus.
</p>
<p>
The more ancient of-the sacred books of the Jews, while distinctly
noticing the nation of the Medes, contain no mention at all of Persia
or the Persians. The Zendavesta, the sacred volume of the people
themselves, is equally silent on the subject. The earliest appearance
of the Persians in history is in the inscriptions of the Assyrian kings,
which begin to notice them about the middle of the ninth century B.C.
At this time Shalmaneser II. found them in south-western Armenia, where
they were in close contact with the Medes, of whom, however, they seem
to have been wholly independent. Like the modern Kurds in this same
region, they owned no subjection to a single head, but were under the
government of numerous petty chieftains, each the lord of a single town
or of a small mountain district. Shalmaneser informs us that he took
tribute from twenty-five such chiefs. Similar tokens of submission were
paid also to his son and grandson. After this the Assyrian records are
silent as to the Persians for nearly a century, and it is not until the
reign of Sennacherib that we once more find them brought into contact
with the power which aspired to be mistress of Asia. At the time of
their reappearance they are no longer in Armenia, but have descended the
line of Zagros and reached the districts which lie north and north-east
of Susiana, or that part of the Bakhtiyari chain which, if it is not
actually within Persia Proper, at any rate immediately adjoins upon it.
Arrived thus far, it was easy for them to occupy the region to which
they have given permanent name; for the Bakhtiyari mountains command it
and give a ready access to its valleys and plains.
</p>
<p>
The Persians would thus appear not to have completed their migrations
till near the close of the Assyrian period, and it is probable that
they did not settle into an organized monarchy much before the fall of
Nineveh. At any rate we hear of no Persian ruler of note or name in the
Assyrian records, and the reign of petty chiefs would seem therefore to
have continued at least to the time of Asshur-bani-pal, up to which date
we have ample records. The establishment, however, about the year
B.C. 660, or a little later, of a powerful monarchy in the kindred and
neighboring Media, could not fail to attract attention, and might well
provoke imitation in Persia; and the native tradition appears to have
been that about this time. Persian royalty began in the person of a
certain Achaemenes (Hakhamanish), from whom all their later monarchs,
with one possible exception, were proud to trace their descent.
</p>
<p>
The name Achaemenes cannot fail to arouse some suspicion. The Greek
genealogies render us so familiar with heroes eponymi&mdash;imaginary
personages, who owe their origin to the mere fact of the existence
of certain tribe or race names, to account for which they were
invented&mdash;that whenever, even in the history of other nations, we
happen upon a name professedly personal, which stands evidently in close
connection with a tribal designation, we are apt at once to suspect it
of being fictitious. But in the East tribal and even ethnic names
were certainly sometimes derived from actual persons; and it may be
questioned whether the Persians, or the Iranic stock generally, had the
notion of inventing personal eponyms. The name Achaemenes, therefore,
in spite of its connection with the royal clan name of Achaemenidae, may
stand as perhaps that of a real Persian king, and, if so, as probably
that of the first king, the original founder of the monarchy, who united
the scattered tribes in one, and thus raised Persia into a power of
considerable importance.
</p>
<p>
The immediate successor of Achaemenes appears to have been his son,
Teispes. Of him and of the next three monarchs, the information that
we possess is exceedingly scanty. The very names of one or two in the
series are uncertain. One tradition assigns either to the second or the
fourth king of the list the establishment of friendly relations with
a certain Pharnaces, King of Cappadocia, by an intermarriage between a
Persian princess, Atossa, and the Cappadocian monarch. The existence
of communication at this time between petty countries politically
unconnected, and placed at such a distance from one another as
Cappadocia and Persia, is certainly what we should not have expected;
but our knowledge of the general condition of Western Asia at the period
is too slight to justify us in a positive rejection of the story, which
indicates, if it be true, that even during this time of comparative
obscurity, the Persian monarchs were widely known, and that their
alliance was thought a matter of importance.
</p>
<p>
The political condition of Persia under these early monarchs is a more
interesting question than either the names of the kings or the foreign
alliances which they attracted. According to Herodotus, that condition
was one of absolute and unqualified subjection to the sway of the Medes,
who conquered Persia and imposed their yoke upon the people before
the year B.C. 634. The native records, however, and the accounts which
Xenophon preferred, represent Persia as being at this time a separate
and powerful state, either wholly independent of Media, or, at any
rate, held in light bonds of little more than nominal dependence. On the
whole, it appears most probable that the true condition of the country
was that which this last phrase expresses. It maybe doubted whether
there had ever been a conquest; but the weaker and less developed of
the two kindred states owned the suzerainty of the stronger, and though
quite unshackled in her internal administration, and perhaps not very
much interfered with in her relations towards foreign countries, was,
formally, a sort of Median fief, standing nearly in the position in
which Egypt now stands to Turkey. The position was irksome to the
sovereigns rather than unpleasant to the people. It detracted from the
dignity of the Persian monarchs, and injured their self-respect; it
probably caused them occasional inconvenience, since from time to time
they would have to pay their court to their suzerain; and it seems
towards the close of the Median period to have involved an obligation
which must have been felt, if not as degrading, at any rate as very
disagreeable. The monarch appears to have been required to send his
eldest son as a sort of hostage to the Court of his superior, where he
was held in a species of honorable captivity, not being allowed to
quit the Court and return home without leave, but being otherwise well
treated. The fidelity of the father was probably supposed to be in this
way secured while it might be hoped that the son would be conciliated,
and made an attached and willing dependent.
</p>
<p>
When Persian history first fairly opens upon us in the pages of Xenophon
and of Nicolaus Damascenus, this is the condition of things which we
find existing. Cambyses, the father of Cyrus the Great&mdash;called Atradates
by the Syrian writer&mdash;is ruler of Persia, and resides in his native
country, while his son Cyrus is permanently, or at any rate usually,
resident at the Median Court, where he is in high favor with the
reigning monarch, Astyages. According to Xenophon, who has here the
support of Herodotus, he is Astyages' grandson, his father, Cambyses,
being married to Mandane, that monarch's daughter. According to
Nicolaus, who in this agrees with Ctesias, he is no way related to
Astyages, who retains him at his court because he is personally attached
to him. In the narrative of the latter writer, which has already been
preferred in these volumes, the young prince, while at the Court,
conceives the idea of freeing his own country by a revolt, and enters
into secret communication with his father for the furtherance of his
object. His father somewhat reluctantly assents, and preparations are
made, which lead to the escape of Cyrus and the commencement of a war
of independence. The details of the struggle, as they are related by
Nicolaus, have been already given. After repeated defeats, the Persians
finally make a stand at Pasargadae, their capital, where in two great
battles they destroy the power of Astyages, who himself remains a
prisoner in the hands of his adversary.
</p>
<p>
In the course of the struggle the father of Cyrus had fallen, and its
close, therefore, presented Cyrus himself before the eyes of the Western
Asiatics as the undisputed lord of the great Arian Empire which had
established itself on the ruins of the Semitic. Transfers of sovereignty
are easily made in the East, where independence is little valued,
and each new conqueror is hailed with acclamations from millions. It
mattered nothing to the bulk of Astyages' subjects whether they were
ruled from Ecbatana or Pasargadae, by Median or Persian masters. Fate
had settled that a single lord was to bear sway over the tribes and
nations dwelling between the Persian Gulf and the Euxine; and the
arbitrament of the sword had now decided that this single lord should be
Cyrus. We may readily believe the statement of Nicolaus that the nations
previously subject to the Medes vied with each other in the celerity
and zeal with which they made their submission to the Persian conqueror.
Cyrus succeeded at once to the full inheritance of which he had
dispossessed Astyages, and was recognized as king by all the tribes
between the Halys and the desert of Khorassan.
</p>
<p>
He was at this time, if we may trust Dino, exactly forty years of age,
and was thus at that happy period in life when the bodily powers
have not yet begun to decay, while the mental are just reaching their
perfection. Though we may not be able to trust implicitly the details of
the war of independence which have come down to us, yet there can be no
doubt that he had displayed in its course very remarkable courage and
conduct. He had intended, probably, no more than to free his country
from the Median yoke; by the force of circumstances he had been led on
to the destruction of the Median power, and to the establishment of a
Persian Empire in its stead. With empire had come an enormous accession
of wealth. The accumulated stores of ages, the riches of the Ninevite
kings&mdash;the "gold," the "silver," and the "pleasant furniture" of those
mighty potentates, of which there was "none end"&mdash;together with all the
additions made to these stores by the Median monarchs, had fallen into
his hands, and from comparative poverty he had come per saltum into the
position of one of the wealthiest&mdash;if not of the very wealthiest&mdash;of
princes. An ordinary Oriental would have been content with such a
result, and have declined to tempt fortune any more. But Cyrus was
no ordinary Oriental. Confident in his own powers, active, not to say
restless, and of an ambition that nothing could satiate, he viewed,
the position which he had won simply as a means of advancing himself to
higher eminence. According to Ctesias, he was scarcely seated upon the
throne, when he led an expedition to the far north-east against the
renowned Bactrians and Sacans; and at any rate, whether this be true or
no&mdash;and most probably it is an anticipation of later occurrences&mdash;it
is certain that, instead of folding his hands, Cyrus proceeded with
scarcely a pause on a long career of conquest, devoting his whole life
to the carrying out of his plans of aggression, and leaving a portion
of his schemes, which were too extensive for one life to realize, as a
legacy to his successor. The quarter to which he really first turned
his attention seems to have been the north-west. There, in the somewhat
narrow but most fertile tract between the river Halys and the Egean Sea,
was a state which seemed likely to give him trouble&mdash;a state which had
successfully resisted all the efforts of the Medes to reduce it, and
which recently, under a warlike prince, had shown a remarkable power
of expansion. An instinct of danger warned the scarce firmly-settled
monarch to fix his eye at once upon Lydia; in the wealthy and successful
Croesus, the Lydian king, he saw one whom dynastic interests might
naturally lead to espouse the quarrel of the conquered Mede, and whose
power and personal qualities rendered him a really formidable rival.
</p>
<p>
The Lydian monarch, on his side, did not scruple to challenge a contest.
The long strife which his father had waged with the great Cyaxares
had terminated in a close alliance, cemented by a marriage, which made
Croesus and Astyages brothers. The friendship of the great power of
Western Asia, secured by this union, had set Lydia free to pursue
a policy of self-aggrandizement in her own immediate, neighborhood.
Rapidly, one after another, the kingdoms of Asia Minor had been reduced;
and, excepting the mountain districts of Lycia and Cilicia, all Asia
within the Halys now owned the sway of the Lydian king. Contented with
his successes, and satisfied that the tie of relationship secured him
from attack on the part of the only power which he had need to fear,
Croesus had for some years given himself up to the enjoyment of his
gains and to an ostentatious display of his magnificence. It was a rude
shock to the indolent and self-complacent dreams of a sanguine optimism,
which looked that "to-morrow should be as to-day, only much more
abundant," when tidings came that revolution had raised its head in the
far south-east, and that an energetic prince, in the full vigor of life,
and untrammelled by dynastic ties, had thrust the aged Astyages from
his throne, and girt his own brows with the Imperial diadem. Croesus,
according to the story, was still in deep grief on account of the
untimely death of his eldest son, when the intelligence reached
him. Instantly rousing himself from his despair, he set about his
preparations for the struggle, which his sagacity saw to be inevitable.
After consultation of the oracles of Greece, he allied himself with the
Grecian community, which appeared to him on the whole to be the most
powerful. At the same time he sent ambassadors to Babylon and Memphis,
to the courts of Labynetus and Amasis, with proposals for an alliance
offensive and defensive between the three secondary powers of the
Eastern world against that leading power whose superior strength and
resources were felt to constitute a common danger. His representations
were effectual. The kings of Babylon and Egypt, alive to their own
peril, accepted his proposals; and a joint league was formed between the
three monarchs and the republic of Sparta for the purpose of resisting
the presumed aggressive spirit of the Medo-Persians.
</p>
<p>
Cyrus, meanwhile, was not idle. Suspecting that a weak point in his
adversary's harness would be the disaffection of some of his more
recently conquered subjects, he sent emissaries into Asia Minor to sound
the dispositions of the natives. These emissaries particularly addressed
themselves to the Asiatic Greeks, who, coming of a freedom-loving stock,
and having been only very lately subdued, would it was thought, be
likely to catch at an opportunity of shaking off the yoke of their
conqueror. But, reasonable as such hopes must have seemed, they were in
this instance doomed to disappointment. The Ionians, instead of hailing
Cyrus as a liberator, received his overtures with suspicion. They
probably thought that they were sure not to gain, and that they might
possibly lose, by a change of masters. The yoke of Croesus had not,
perhaps, been very oppressive; at any rate it seemed to them preferable
to "bear the ills they had," rather than "fly to others" which might
turn out less tolerable.
</p>
<p>
Disappointed in this quarter, the Persian prince directed his efforts to
the concentration of a large army, and its rapid advance into a position
where it would be excellently placed both for defence and attack. The
frontier province of Cappadocia, which was only separated from the
dominions of the Lydian monarch by a stream of moderate size, the
Halys, was a most defensible country, extremely fertile and productive,
abounding in natural fastnesses, and inhabited by a brave and warlike
population. Into this district Cyrus pushed forward his army with all
speed, taking, as it would seem, not the short route through Diarbekr,
Malatiyah, and Gurun, along which the "Royal Road" afterwards ran,
but the more circuitous one by Erzerum, which brought him into Northern
Cappadocia, or Pontus, as it was called by the Romans. Here, in a
district named Pteria, which cannot have been very far from the coast,
he found his adversary, who had crossed the Halys, and taken several
Cappadocian towns, among which was the chief city of the Pterians.
Perceiving that his troops considerably outnumbered those of Crcesus, he
lost no time in giving him battle. The action was fought in the Pterian
country, and was stoutly contested, terminating at nightfall without any
decisive advantage to either party. The next day neither side made any
movement; and Crcesus, concluding from his enemy's inaction that, though
he had not been able to conquer him, he had nothing to fear from
his desire of vengeance or his spirit of enterprise, determined on
a retreat. He laid the blame of his failure, we are told, on the
insufficient number of his troops, and purposed to call for the
contingents of his allies, and renew the war with largely augmented
forces in the ensuing spring.
</p>
<p>
Cyrus, on his part, allowed the Lydians to retire unmolested, thus
confirming his adversary in the mistaken estimate which he had formed of
Persian courage and daring. Anticipating the course which Croesus would
adopt under the circumstances, he kept his army well in hand, and, as
soon as the Lydians were clean gone, he crossed the Halys, and marched
straight upon Sardis. Croesus, deeming himself safe from molestation,
had no sooner reached his capital than he had dismissed the bulk of
his troops to their homes for the winter, merely giving them orders to
return in the spring, when he hoped to have received auxiliaries
from Sparta, Babylon, and Egypt. Left thus almost without defence, he
suddenly heard that his audacious foe had followed on his steps, had
ventured into the heart of his dominions, and was but a short distance
from the capital. In this crisis he showed a spirit well worthy of
admiration. Putting himself at the head of such an army of native
Lydians as he could collect at a few hours' notice, he met the advancing
foe in the rich plain a little to the east of Sardis, and gave him
battle immediately. It is possible that even under these disadvantageous
circumstances he might in fair fight have been victorious, for the
Lydian cavalry were at this time excellent, and decidedly superior
to the Persian. But Cyrus, aware of their merits, had recourse to
stratagem, and by forming his camels in front, so frightened the Lydian
horses that they fled from the field. The riders dismounted and fought
on foot, but their gallantry was unavailing. After a prolonged and
bloody combat the Lydian army was defeated, and forced to take refuge
behind the walls of the capital.
</p>
<p>
Croesus now in hot haste sent off fresh messengers to his allies,
begging them to come at once to his assistance. He had still a good hope
of maintaining himself till their arrival, for his city was defended
by walls, and was regarded by the natives as impregnable. An attempt to
storm the defences failed; and the siege must have been turned into
a blockade but for an accidental discovery. A Persian soldier had
approached to reconnoitre the citadel on the side where it was strongest
by nature, and therefore guarded with least care, when he observed one
of the garrison descend the rock after his helmet, which had fallen from
his head, pick it up, and return with it. Being an expert climber, he
attempted the track thus pointed out to him, and succeeded in reaching
the summit. Several of his comrades followed in his steps; the citadel
was surprised, and the town taken and plundered.
</p>
<p>
Thus fell the greatest city of Asia Minor after a siege of fourteen
days. The Lydian monarch, it is said, narrowly escaped with his life
from the confusion of the sack; but, being fortunately recognized
in time, was made prisoner, and brought before Cyrus. Cyrus at first
treated him with some harshness, but soon relented, and, with that
clemency which was a common characteristic of the earlier Persian kings,
assigned him a territory for his maintenance, and gave him an honorable
position at Court, where he passed at least thirty years, in high favor,
first with Cyrus, and then with Cambyses. Lydia itself was absorbed at
once into the Persian Empire, together with most of its dependencies,
which submitted as soon as the fall of Sardis was known. There still,
however, remained a certain amount of subjugation to be effected. The
Greeks of the coast, who had offended the Great King by their refusal of
his overtures, were not to be allowed to pass quietly into the condition
of tributaries; and there were certain native races in the south-western
corner of Asia Minor which declined to submit without a struggle to
the new conqueror. But these matters were not regarded by Cyrus as
of sufficient importance to require his own personal superintendence.
Having remained at Sardis for a few weeks, during which time he received
an insulting message from Sparta, whereto he made a menacing reply, and
having arranged for the government of the newly-conquered province and
the transmission of its treasures to Ecbatana, he quitted Lydia for
the interior, taking Croesus with him, and proceeded towards the
Median capital. He was bent on prosecuting without delay his schemes
of conquest in other quarters&mdash;schemes of a grandeur and a
comprehensiveness unknown to any previous monarch.
</p>
<p>
Scarcely, however, was he departed when Sardis became the scene of an
insurrection. Pactyas, a Lydian, who had been entrusted with the duty
of conveying the treasures of Croesus and his more wealthy subjects to
Ecbatana, revolted against Tabalus, the Persian commandant of the town,
and being joined by the native population and numerous mercenaries,
principally Greeks, whom he hired with the treasure that was in his
hands, made himself master of Sardis, and besieged Tabalus in the
citadel. The news reached Cyrus while he was upon his march; but,
estimating the degree of its importance aright, he did not suffer it to
interfere with his plans. He judged it enough to send a general with
a strong body of troops to put down the revolt, and continued his own
journey eastward. Mazares, a Mede, was the officer selected for
the service. On arriving before Sardis, he found that Pactyas had
relinquished his enterprise and fled to the coast, and that the revolt
was consequently at an end. It only remained to exact vengeance. The
rebellious Lydians were disarmed. Pactyas was pursued with unrelenting
hostility, and demanded, in succession, of the Cymaeans, the
Mytilenseans, and the Chians, of whom the last-mentioned surrendered
him. The Greek cities which had furnished Pactyas with auxiliaries were
then attacked, and the inhabitants of the first which fell, Priene, were
one and all sold as slaves.
</p>
<p>
Mazares soon afterwards died, and was succeeded by Ha-pagus, another
Mede, who adopted a somewhat milder policy towards the unfortunate
Greeks. Besieging their cities one by one, and taking them by means
of banks or mounds piled up against the walls, he, in some instances,
connived at the inhabitants escaping in their ships, while, in others,
he allowed them to take up the ordinary position of Persian subjects,
liable to tribute and military service, but not otherwise molested. So
little irksome were such terms to the Ionians of this period that even
those who dwelt in the islands off the coast, with the single exception
of the Samians&mdash;though they ran no risk of subjugation, since the
Persians did not possess a fleet&mdash;accepted voluntarily the same
position, and enrolled themselves among the subjects of Cyrus.
</p>
<p>
One Greek continental town alone suffered nothing during this time of
trouble. When Cyrus refused the offers of submission, which reached him
from the Ionian and AEolian Greeks after his capture of Sardis, he made
an exception in favor of Miletus, the most important of all the Grecian
cities in Asia. Prudence, it is probable, rather than clemency, dictated
this course, since to detach from the Grecian cause the most powerful
and influential of the states was the readiest way of weakening the
resistance they would be able to make. Miletus singly had defied the
arms of four successive Lydian kings, and had only succumbed at last
to the efforts of the fifth, Croesus. If her submission had been now
rejected, and she had been obliged to take counsel of her despair, the
struggle between the Greek cities and the Persian generals might have
assumed a different character.
</p>
<p>
Still more different might have been the result, if the cities
generally had had the wisdom to follow a piece of advice which the great
philosopher and statesman of the time, Thales, the Milesian, is said
to have given them. Thales suggested that the Ionians should form
themselves into a confederation, to be governed by a congress which
should meet at Teos, the several cities retaining their own laws and
internal independence, but being united for military purposes into a
single community. Judged by the light which later events, the great
Ionian revolt especially, throw upon it, this advice is seen to have
been of the greatest importance. It is difficult to say what check, or
even reverse, the arms of Persia might not have at this time sustained,
if the spirit of Thales had animated his Asiatic countrymen generally;
if the loose Ionic Amphictyony, which in reality left each state in
the hour of danger to its own resources, had been superseded by a
true federal union, and the combined efforts of the thirteen Ionian
communities had been directed to a steady resistance of Persian
aggression and a determined maintenance of their own independence.
Mazares and Harpagus would almost certainly have been baffled, and the
Great King himself would probably have been called off from his eastern
conquests to undertake in person a task which after all he might have
failed to accomplish.
</p>
<p>
The fall of the last Ionian town left Harpagus free to turn his
attention to the tribes of the south-west which had not yet made their
submission&mdash;the Carians, the Dorian Greeks, the Caunians, and the people
of Lycia. Impressing the services of the newly-conquered Ionians and
AEolians, he marched first against Caria, which offered but a feeble
resistance. The Dorians of the continent, Myndians, Halicarnassians, and
Cnidians. submitted still more tamely, without any struggle at all; but
the Caunians and Lycians showed a different spirit. These tribes, which
were ethnically allied, and of a very peculiar type, had never yet, it
would seem, been subdued by any conqueror. Prizing highly the liberty
they had enjoyed so long, they defended themselves with desperation.
When they were defeated in the field they shut themselves up within
the walls of their chief cities, Caunus and Xanthus, where, finding
resistance impossible, they set fire to the two places with their own
hands, burned their wives, children, slaves, and valuables, and then
sallying forth, sword in hand, fell on the besiegers' lines, and fought
till they were all slain.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Cyrus was pursuing a career of conquest in the far east. It
was now, according to Herodotus, who is, beyond all question, a better
authority than Ctesias for the reign of Cyrus, that the reduction of the
Bactrians and the Sacans, the chief nations of what is called by moderns
Central Asia, took place. Bactria was a country which enjoyed the
reputation of having been great and glorious at a very early date. In
one of the most ancient portions of the Zendavesta it was celebrated
as "Bahhdi eredhwo-drafsha," or "Bactria" with the lofty banner; and
traditions not wholly to be despised made it the native country of
Zoroaster. There is good reason to believe that, up to the date of
Cyras, it had maintained its independence, or at any rate that it had
been untouched by the great monarchies which for above seven hundred
years had borne sway in the western parts of Asia. Its people were
of the Iranic stock, and retained in their remote and somewhat savage
country the simple and primitive habits of the race. Though their arms
were of indifferent character, they were among the best soldiers to
be found in the East, and always showed themselves a formidable enemy.
According to Ctesias, when Cyrus invaded them, they fought a pitched
battle with his army, in which the victory was with neither party.
They were not, he said, reduced by force of arms at all, but submitted
voluntarily when they found that Cyrus had married a Median princess.
Herodotus, on the contrary, seems to include the Bactrians among the
nations which Cyrus subdued, and probability is strongly in favor of
this view of the matter. So warlike a nation is not likely to have
submitted unless to force; nor is there any ground to believe that a
Median marriage, had Cyrus contracted one, would have made him any the
more acceptable to the Bactrians.
</p>
<p>
On the conquest of Bactria followed, we may be tolerably sure, an attack
upon the Sacae. This people, who must certainly have bordered on the
Bactrians, dwelt probably either on the Pamir Steppe, or on the high
plain of Chinese Tartary, east of the Bolar range&mdash;the modern districts
of Kashgar and Yarkand. They were reckoned excellent soldiers. They
fought with the bow, the dagger, and the battle-axe, and were equally
formidable on horseback and on foot. In race they were probably Tatars
or Turanians, and their descendants or their congeners are to be seen
in the modern inhabitants of these regions. According to Ctesias, their
women took the field in almost equal numbers with their men; and the
mixed army which resisted Cyrus amounted, including both sexes, to half
a million. The king who commanded them was a certain Amorges, who was
married to a wife called Sparethra. In an engagement with the Persians
he fell into the enemy's hands, whereupon Sparethra put herself at the
head of the Sacan forces, defeated Cyrus, and took so many prisoners
of importance that the Persian monarch was glad to release Amorges in
exchange for them. The Sacse, however, notwithstanding this success,
were reduced, and became subjects and tributaries of Persia.
</p>
<p>
Among other countries subdued by Cyrus in this neighborhood, probably
about the same period, may be named Hyrcania, Parthia, Chorasmia,
Sogdiana, Aria (or Herat), Drangiana, Arachosia, Sattagydia, and
Gandaria. The brief epitome which we possess of Ctesias omits to make
any mention of these minor conquests, while Herodotus sums them all
up in a single line; but there is reason to believe that the Cnidian
historian gave a methodized account of their accomplishment, of which
scattered notices have come down to us in various writers. Arrian
relates that there was a city called Cyropolis, situated on the
Jaxartes, a place of great strength defended by very lofty walls, which
had been founded by the Great Cyrus. This city belonged to Sogdiana.
Pliny states that Capisa, the chief city of Capisene, which lay not far
from the upper Indus, was destroyed by Cyrus. This place is probably
Kafshan, a little to the north of Kabul. Several authors tell us that
the Ariaspse, a people of Drangiana, assisted Cyrus with provisions when
he was warring in their neighborhood, and received from him in return a
new name, which the Greeks rendered by "Euergetse"&mdash;"Benefactors." The
Ariaspae must have dwelt near the Hamoon, or Lake of Seistan. We have
thus traces of the conqueror's presence in the extreme north on the
Jaxartes, in the extreme east in Affghanistan, and towards the south as
far as Seistan and the Helmend; nor can there be any reasonable doubt
that he overran and reduced to subjection the whole of that vast tract
which lies between the Caspian on the west, the Indus valley and the
desert of Tartary towards the east, the Jaxartes or Sir Deria on the
north, and towards the south the Great Deserts of Seistan and Khorassan.
</p>
<p>
More uncertainty attaches to the reduction of the tract lying south
of these deserts. Tradition said that Cyrus had once penetrated into
Gedrosia on an expedition against the Indians, and had lost his entire
army in the waterless and trackless desert; but there is no evidence at
all that he reduced the country. It appears to have been a portion of
the Empire in the reign of Darius Hystaspis, but whether that monarch,
or Cambyses, or the great founder of the Persian power conquered it,
cannot at present be determined.
</p>
<p>
The conquest of the vast tract lying between the Caspian and the
Indus, inhabited (as it was) by a numerous, valiant, and freedom-loving
population, may well have occupied Cyrus for thirteen or fourteen years.
Alexander the Great spent in the reduction of this region, after the
inhabitants had in a great measure lost their warlike qualities, as
much as five years, or half the time occupied by his whole series of
conquests. Cyrus could not have ventured on prosecuting his enterprises,
as did the Macedonian prince, continuously and without interruption,
marching straight from one country to another without once revisiting
his capital. He must from time to time have returned to Ecbatana or
Pasargadae; and it is on the whole most probable that, like the Assyrian
monarchs, he marched out from home on a fresh expedition almost every
year. Thus it need cause us no surprise that fourteen years were
consumed in the subjugation of the tribes and nations beyond the Iranic
desert to the north and the north-east, and that it was not till B.C.
539, when he was nearly sixty years of age, that the Persian monarch
felt himself free to turn his attention to the great kingdom of the
south.
</p>
<p>
The expedition of Cyrus against Babylon has been described already.
Its success added to the Empire the rich and valuable provinces of
Babylonia, Susiana, Syria, and Palestine, thus augmenting its size by
about 240,000 or 250,000 square miles. Far more important, however,
than this geographical increase was the removal of the last formidable
rival&mdash;the complete destruction of a power which represented to the
Asiatics the old Semitic civilization, which with reason claimed to be
the heir and the successor of Assyria, and had a history stretching back
for a space of nearly two thousand years. So long as Babylon, "the
glory of kingdoms," "the praise of the whole earth," retained her
independence, with her vast buildings, her prestige of antiquity, her
wealth, her learning, her ancient and grand religious system, she could
scarcely fail to be in the eyes of her neighbors the first power in the
world, if not in mere strength, yet in honor, dignity, and reputation.
Haughty and contemptuous herself to the very last, she naturally imposed
on men's minds, alike by her past history and her present pretensions;
nor was it possible for the Persian monarch to feel that he stood before
his subjects as indisputably the foremost man upon the earth until he
had humbled in the dust the pride and arrogance of Babylon. But, with
the fall of the Great City, the whole fabric of Semetic greatness was
shattered. Babylon became "an astonishment and a hissing"&mdash;all her
prestige vanished&mdash;and Persia stepped manifestly into the place, which
Assyria had occupied for so many centuries, of absolute and unrivalled
mistress of Western Asia.
</p>
<p>
The fall of Babylon was also the fall of an ancient, widely spread,
and deeply venerated religious system. Not of course, that the religion
suddenly disappeared or ceased to have votaries, but that, from a
dominant system, supported by all the resources of the state, and
enforced by the civil power over a wide extent of territory, it became
simply one of many tolerated beliefs, exposed to frequent rebuffs and
insults, and at all times overshadowed by a new and rival system&mdash;the
comparatively pure creed of Zoroastrianism, The conquest of Babylon by
Persia was, practically, if not a death-blow, at least a severe wound,
to that sensuous idol-worship which had for more than twenty centuries
been the almost universal religion in the countries between the
Mediterranean and the Zagros mountain range. The religion never
recovered itself&mdash;was never reinstated. It survived, a longer or a
shorter time, in places. To a slight extent it corrupted Zoroastrianism;
but, on the whole, from the date of the fall of Babylon it declined.
"Bel bowed down; Nebo stooped;" "Merodach was broken in pieces."
Judgment was done upon the Babylonian graven images; and the system, of
which they formed a necessary part, having once fallen from its proud
pre-eminence, gradually decayed and vanished.
</p>
<p>
Parallel with the decline of the old Semitic idolatry was the advance
of its direct antithesis, pure spiritual Monotheism. The same blow which
laid the Babylonian religion in the dust struck off the fetters from
Judaism. Purified and refined by the precious discipline of adversity,
the Jewish system, which Cyrus, feeling towards it a natural sympathy,
protected, upheld, and replaced in its proper locality, advanced from
this time in influence and importance, leavening little by little the
foul mass of superstition and impurity which came in contact with it.
Proselytism grew more common. The Jews spread themselves wider. The
return from, the captivity, which Cyrus authorized almost immediately
after the capture of Babylon, is the starting point from which we may
trace a gradual enlightenment of the heathen world by the dissemination
of Jewish beliefs and practices&mdash;such dissemination being greatly helped
by the high estimation in which the Jewish system was held by the civil
authority, both while the empire of the Persians lasted, and when power
passed to the Macedonians.
</p>
<p>
On the fall of Babylon its dependencies seem to have submitted to
the conqueror, with a single exception. Phoenicia, which had never
acquiesced contentedly either in Assyrian or in Babylonian rule, saw,
apparently, in the fresh convulsion that was now shaking the East, an
opportunity for recovering autonomy. It was nearly half a century since
her last struggle to free herself had terminated unsuccessfully. A new
generation had grown up since that time&mdash;a generation which had seen
nothing of war, and imperfectly appreciated its perils. Perhaps some
reliance was placed on the countenance and support of Egypt, which, it
must have been felt, would view with satisfaction any obstacle to the
advance of a power wherewith she was sure, sooner or later, to come into
collision. At any rate, it was resolved to make the venture. Phoenicia,
on the destruction of her distant suzerain, quietly resumed her freedom;
abstained from making any act of submission to the conqueror; while,
however, at the same time, she established friendly relations for
commercial purposes with one of the conqueror's vassals, the prince who
had been sent into Palestine to re-establish the Jews at Jerusalem.
</p>
<p>
It might have been expected that Cyrus, after his conquest of Babylon,
would have immediately proceeded towards the south-west. The reduction
of Egypt had, according to Herodotus, been embraced in the designs which
he formed fifteen years earlier. The non-submission of Phoenicia
must have been regarded as an act of defiance which deserved signal
chastisement. It has been suspected that the restoration of the Jews was
prompted, at least in part, by political motives, and that Cyrus, when
he re-established them in their country, looked to finding them of use
to him in the attack which he was meditating upon Egypt. At any rate it
is evident that their presence would have facilitated his march through
Palestine, and given him a <i>point d'appui</i>, which could not but have
been of value. These considerations make it probable that an Egyptian
expedition would have been determined on, had not circumstances occurred
to prevent it.
</p>
<p>
What the exact circumstances were, it is impossible to determine.
According to Herodotus, a sudden desire seized Cyrus to attack the
Massagetae, who bordered his Empire to the north-east. He led his troops
across the Araxes (Jaxartes?), defeated the Massagetae by stratagem in
a great battle, but was afterwards himself defeated and slain, his body
falling into the enemy's hands, who treated it with gross indignity.
According to Ctesias, the people against whom he made his expedition
were the Derbices, a nation bordering upon India, Assisted by Indian
allies, who lent them a number of elephants, this people engaged Cyrus,
and defeated him in a battle, wherein he received a mortal wound.
Reinforced, however, by a body of Sacae, the Persians renewed the
struggle, and gained a complete victory, which was followed by the
submission of the nation. Cyrus, however, died of his wound on the third
day after the first battle.
</p>
<p>
This conflict of testimony clouds with uncertainty the entire closing
scene of the life of Cyrus. All that we can lay down as tolerably well
established is, that instead of carrying out his designs against Egypt,
he engaged in hostilities with one of the nations on his north-eastern
frontier, that he conducted the war with less than his usual success,
and in the course of it received a wound of which he died (B.C. 529),
after he had reigned nine-and-twenty years. That his body did not fall
into the enemy's hands appears, however, to be certain from the fact
that it was conveyed into Persia Proper, and buried at Pasargadae.
</p>
<p>
It may be suspected that this expedition, which proved so disastrous to
the Persian monarch, was not the mere wanton act which it appears to be
in the pages of our authorities. The nations of the north-east were at
all times turbulent and irritable, with difficulty held in check by the
civilized power that bore rule in the south and west. The expedition
of Cyrus, whether directed against the Massagetae or the Derbices, was
probably intended to strike terror into the barbarians of these regions,
and was analogous to those invasions which were undertaken under the
wisest of the Roman Emperors, across the Rhine and Danube, against
Germans, Goths, and Sarmatae. The object of such inroads was not to
conquer, but to alarm&mdash;it was hoped by an imposing display of organized
military force to deter the undisciplined hordes of the prolific North
from venturing across the frontier and carrying desolation through large
tracts of the Empire. Defensive warfare has often an aggressive look. It
may have been solely with the object of protecting his own territories
from attack that Cyrus made his last expedition across the Jaxertes, or
towards the upper Indus.
</p>
<p>
The character of Cyrus, as represented to us by the Greeks, is the
most favorable that we possess of any early Oriental monarch. Active,
energetic, brave, fertile in stratagems, he has all the qualities
required to form a successful military chief. He conciliates his people
by friendly and familiar treatment, but declines to spoil them by
yielding to their inclinations when they are adverse to their true
interests. He has a ready humor, which shows itself in smart sayings and
repartees, that take occasionally the favorite Oriental turn of parable
or apologue. He is mild in his treatment of the prisoners that fall into
his hands, and ready to forgive even the heinous crime of rebellion. He
has none of the pride of the ordinary eastern despot, but converses on
terms of equality with those about him. We cannot be surprised that the
Persians, contrasting him with their later monarchs, held his memory
in the highest veneration, and were even led by their affection for
his person to make his type of countenance their standard of physical
beauty.
</p>
<p>
The genius of Cyrus was essentially that of a conqueror, not of an
administrator. There is no trace of his having adopted anything like a
uniform system for the government of the provinces which he subdued.
In Lydia he set up a Persian governor, but assigned certain important
functions to a native; in Babylon he gave the entire direction of
affairs into the hands of a Mede, to whom he allowed the title and style
of king; in Judaea he appointed a native, but made him merely "governor"
or "deputy;" in Sacia he maintained as tributary king the monarch who
had resisted his arms. Policy may have dictated the course pursued
in each instance, which may have been suited to the condition of the
several provinces; but the variety allowed was fatal to consolidation,
and the monarchy, as Cyrus left it, had as little cohesion as any of
those by which it was preceded.
</p>
<p>
Though originally a rude mountain-chief, Cyrus, after he succeeded to
empire, showed himself quite able to appreciate the dignity and value
of art. In his constructions at Pasargadae he combined massiveness
with elegance, and manifested a taste at once simple and refined. He
ornamented his buildings with reliefs of an ideal character. It is
probably to him that we owe the conception of the light tapering stone
shaft, which is the glory of Persian architecture. If the more massive
of the Persepolitan buildings are to be ascribed to him, we must regard
him as haying fixed the whole plan and arrangement which was afterwards
followed in all Persian palatial edifices.
</p>
<p>
In his domestic affairs Cyrus appears to have shown the same moderation
and simplicity which we observe in his general conduct. He married, as
it would seem, one wife only, Cassandane, the daughter of Pharnaspes,
who was a member of the royal family. By her he had issue two sons
and at least three daughters. The sons were Cambyses and Smerdis;
the daughters Atossa, Artystone, and one whose name is unknown to us.
Cassandane died before her husband, and was deeply mourned by him.
Shortly before his own death he took the precaution formally to settle
the succession. Leaving the general inheritance of his vast dominions to
his elder son, Cambyses, he declared it to be his will that the younger
should be entrusted with the actual government of several large and
important provinces. He thought by this plan to secure the well-being of
both the youths, never suspecting that he was in reality consigning
both to untimely ends, and even preparing the way for an extraordinary
revolution.
</p>
<p>
The ill effect of the unfortunate arrangement thus made appeared almost
immediately. Cambyses was scarcely settled upon the throne before he
grew jealous of his brother, and ordered him to be privately put to
death. His cruel orders were obeyed, and with so much secrecy that
neither the mode of the death, nor even the fact, was known to more than
a few. Smerdis was generally believed to be still alive; and thus an
opportunity was presented for personation&mdash;a form of imposture very
congenial to Orientals, and one which has often had very disastrous
consequences. We shall find in the sequel this opportunity embraced, and
results follow of a most stirring and exciting character.
</p>
<p>
It required time, however, to bring to maturity the fruits of the crime
so rashly committed. Cambyses, in the meanwhile, quite unconscious of
danger, turned his attention to military matters, and determined on
endeavoring to complete his father's scheme of conquest by the reduction
of Egypt. Desirous of obtaining a ground of quarrel less antiquated
than the alliance, a quarter of a century earlier, between Amasis and
Croesus, he demanded that a daughter of the Egyptian king should be sent
to him as a secondary wife. Amasis, too timid to refuse, sent a damsel
named Nitetis, who was not his daughter; and she, soon after her
arrival, made Cambyses acquainted with the fraud. A ground of quarrel
was thus secured, which might be put forward when it suited his purpose;
and meanwhile every nerve was being strained to prepare effectually
for the expedition. The difficulty of a war with Egypt lay in her
inaccessibility. She was protected on all sides by seas or deserts; and,
for a successful advance upon her from the direction of Asia, it was
desirable both to obtain a quiet passage for a large army through the
desert of El-Tij, and also to have the support of a powerful fleet in
the Mediterranean. This latter was the paramount consideration. An army
well supplied with camels might carry its provisions and water through
the desert, and might intimidate or overpower the few Arab tribes which
inhabited it; but, unless the command of the sea was gained and the
navigation of the Nile closed, Memphis might successfully resist
attack. Cambyses appears to have perceived with sufficient clearness
the conditions on which victory depended, and to have applied himself at
once to securing them. He made a treaty with the Arab Sheikh who had the
chief influence over the tribes of the desert; and at the same time
he set to work to procure the services of a powerful naval force. By
menaces or negotiations he prevailed upon the Phoenicians to submit
themselves to his yoke, and having thus obtained a fleet superior to
that of Egypt, he commenced hostilities by robbing her of a dependency
which possessed considerable naval strength, in this way still further
increasing the disparity between his own fleet and that of his enemy.
Against the combined ships of Phoenicia, Cyprus, Ionia, and AEolis,
Egypt was powerless, and her fleets seem to have quietly yielded the
command of the sea. Cambyses was thus able to give his army the support
of a naval force, as it marched along the coast, from Carmel probably
to Pelusium; and when, having defeated the Egyptians at the last-named
place, he proceeded against Memphis, he was able to take possession of
the Nile, and to blockade the Egyptian capital both by land and water.
</p>
<p>
It appears that four years were consumed by the Persian monarch in his
preparations for his Egyptian expedition. It was not until B.C. 525 that
he entered Egypt at the head of his troops, and fought the great battle
which decided the fate of the country. The struggle was long and bloody.
Psammenitus, who had succeeded his father Amasis, had the services, not
only of his Egyptian subjects, but a large body of mercenaries besides,
Greeks and Carians. These allies were zealous in his cause, and are said
to have given him a horrible proof of their attachment. One of
their body had deserted to the Persians some little time before the
expedition, and was believed to have given important advice to the
invader. He had left his children behind in Egypt; and these his former
comrades now seized, and led out in front of their lines, where they
slew them before their father's eyes, and, having so done, mixed their
blood in a bowl with water and wine, and drank, one and all, of the
mixture. The battle followed immediately after; but, in spite of their
courage and fanaticism, the Egyptian army was completely defeated.
According to Ctesias, fifty thousand fell on the vanquished side, while
the victors lost no more than seven thousand. Psammenitus, after his
defeat, threw himself into Memphis, but, being blockaded by land
and prevented from receiving supplies from the sea, after a stout
resistance, he surrendered. The captive monarch received the respectful
treatment which Persian clemency usually accorded to fallen sovereigns.
Herodotus even goes so far as to intimate that, if he had abstained from
conspiracy, he would probably have been allowed to continue ruler
of Egypt, exchanging, of course, his independent sovereignty for a
delegated kingship held at the pleasure of the Lord of Asia.
</p>
<p>
The conquest of Egypt was immediately followed by the submission of the
neighboring tribes. The Libyans of the desert tract which borders the
Nile valley to the west, and even the Greeks of the more remote Barca
and Cyrene, sent gifts to the conqueror and consented to become his
tributaries. But Cambyses placed little value on such petty accessions
to his power. Inheriting the grandeur of view which had characterized
his father, he was no sooner master of Egypt than he conceived the idea
of a magnificent series of conquests in this quarter, whereby he hoped
to become Lord of Africa no less than of Asia, or at any rate to leave
himself without a rival of any importance on the vast continent which
his victorious arms had now opened to him. Apart from Egypt, Africa
possessed but two powers capable, by their political organization and
their military strength, of offering him serious resistance. These were
Ethiopia and Carthage&mdash;the one the great power of the South, the equal,
if not even the superior, of Egypt&mdash;the other the great power of the
West&mdash;remote, little known, but looming larger for, the obscurity in
which she was shrouded, and attractive from her reputed wealth. The
views of Cambyses comprised the reduction of both these powers, and
also the conquest of the oasis of Ammon. As a good Zoroastrian, he was
naturally anxious to exhibit the superiority of Ormazd to all the
"gods of the nations;" and, as the temple of Ammon in the oasis had the
greatest repute of all the African shrines, this design would be best
accomplished by its pillage and destruction. It is probable that he
further looked to the subjugation of all the tribes on the north coast
between the Nile valley and the Carthaginian territory; for he would
undoubtedly have sent an army along the shore to act in concert with his
fleet, had he decided ultimately on making the expedition. An unexpected
obstacle, however, arose to prevent him. The Phoenicians, who formed
the main strength of his navy, declined to take any part in an attack
on Carthage, since the Carthaginians were their colonists, and the
relations between the two people had always been friendly. Cambyses
did not like to force their inclinations, on account of their recent
voluntary submission; and as, without their aid, his navy was manifestly
unequal to the proposed service, he felt obliged to desist from the
undertaking.
</p>
<p>
While the Carthaginian scheme was thus nipped in the bud, the
enterprises which Cambyses attempted to carry out led to nothing but
disaster. An army, fifty thousand strong, despatched from Thebes against
Ammon, perished to a man amid the sands of the Libyan desert. A still
more numerous force, led by Cambyses himself towards the Ethiopian
frontier, found itself short of supplies on its march across Nubia, and
was forced to return, without glory, after suffering considerable loss.
It became evident that the abilities of the Persian monarch were
not equal to his ambition&mdash;that he insufficiently appreciated the
difficulties and dangers of enterprises&mdash;while a fatal obstinacy
prevented him from acknowledging and retrieving an error while retrieval
was possible. The Persians, we may be sure, grew dispirited under such
a leader; and the Egyptians naturally took heart. It seems to have
been shortly after the return of Cambyses from his abortive expedition
against Ethiopia that symptoms of an intention to revolt began to
manifest themselves in Egypt. The priests declared an incarnation of
Apis, and the whole country burst out into rejoicings. It was probably
now that Psammenitus, who had hitherto been kindly treated by his
captor, was detected in treasonable intrigues, condemned to death, and
executed. At the same time, the native officers who had been left in
charge of the city of Memphis were apprehended and capitally punished.
Such stringent measures had all the effect that was expected from them;
they wholly crushed the nascent rebellion; they left, however, behind
them a soreness, felt alike by the conqueror and the conquered, which
prevented the establishment of a good understanding between the Great
King and his new subjects. Cambyses knew that he had been severe, and
that his severity had made him many enemies; he suspected the people,
and still more suspected the priests, their natural leaders; he soon
persuaded himself that policy required in Egypt a departure from the
principles of toleration which were ordinarily observed towards their
subjects by the Persians, and a sustained effort on the part of the
civil power to bring the religion, and its priests, into contempt.
Accordingly, he commenced a serious of acts calculated to have this
effect. He stabbed the sacred calf, believed to be incarnate Apis; he
ordered the body of priests who had the animal in charge to be publicly
scourged; he stopped the Apis festival by making participation in it a
capital offence; he opened the receptacles of the dead, and curiously
examined the bodies contained in them, he intruded himself into the
chief sanctuary at Memphis, and publicly scoffed at the grotesque
image of Phtha; finally, not content with outraging in the same way the
inviolable temple of the Cabeiri, he wound up his insults by ordering
that their images should be burnt. These injuries and indignities
rankled in the minds of the Egyptians, and probably had a large share in
producing that bitter hatred of the Persian yoke which shows itself in
the later history on so many occasions; but for the time the policy was
successful: crushed beneath the iron heel of the conqueror&mdash;their faith
in the power of their gods shaken, their spirits cowed, their hopes
shattered&mdash;the Egyptian subjects of Cambyses made up their minds to
submission. The Oriental will generally kiss the hand that smites him,
if it only smite hard enough. Egypt became now for a full generation the
obsequious slave of Persia, and gave no more trouble to her subjugator
than the weakest or the most contented of the provinces.
</p>
<p>
The work of subjection completed, Cambyses, having been absent from his
capital longer than was at all prudent, prepared to return home. He had
proceeded on his way as far as Syria, when intelligence reached him of
a most unexpected nature. A herald suddenly entered his camp and
proclaimed, in the hearing of the whole army, that Cambyses, son of
Cyrus, had ceased to reign, and that the allegiance of all Persian
subjects was henceforth to be paid to Smerdis, son of Cyrus. At first,
it is said, Cambyses thought that his instrument had played him false,
and that his brother was alive and had actually seized the throne; but
the assurances of the suspected person, and a suggestion which he made,
convinced him of the contrary, and gave him a clue to the real solution
of the mystery. Prexaspes, the nobleman inculpated, knew that the
so-called Smerdis must be an impostor, and suggested his identity with
a certain Magus, whose brother had been intrusted by Cambyses with the
general direction of his household and the care of the palace. He was
probably led to make the suggestion by his knowledge of the resemblance
borne by this person to the murdered prince, which was sufficiently
close to make personation possible. Cambyses was thus enabled to
appreciate the gravity of the crisis, and to consider whether he could
successfully contend with it or no. Apparently, he decided in the
negative. Believing that he could not triumph over the conspiracy
which had decreed his downfall, and unwilling to descend to a private
station&mdash;perhaps even uncertain whether his enemies would spare his
life&mdash;he resolved to fly to the last refuge of a dethroned king, and
to end all by suicide. Drawing his short sword from its sheath, he gave
himself a wound, of which he died in a few days.
</p>
<p>
It is certainly surprising that the king formed this resolution. He
was at the head of an army, returning from an expedition, which, if
not wholly successful, had at any rate added to the empire an important
province. His father's name was a tower of strength; and if he could
only have exposed the imposture that had been practised on them,
he might have counted confidently on rallying the great mass of the
Persians to his cause. How was it that he did not advance on the
capital, and at least strike one blow for empire? No clear and decided
response can be made to this inquiry; but we may indistinctly discern
a number of causes which may have combined to produce in the monarch's
mind the feeling of despondency whereto he gave way. Although he
returned from Egypt a substantial conqueror, his laurel wreath was
tarnished by ill-success; his army, weakened by its losses, and
dispirited by its failures, was out of heart; it had no trust in
his capacity as a commander, and could not be expected to fight with
enthusiasm on his behalf. There is also reason to believe that he was
generally unpopular on account of his haughty and tyrannical temper,
and his contempt of law and usage, where they interfered with the
gratification of his desires. Though we should do wrong to accept as
true all the crimes laid to his charge by the Egyptians, who detested
his memory, we cannot doubt the fact of his incestuous marriage with his
sister, Atossa, which was wholly repugnant to the religious feelings of
his nation. Nor can we well imagine that there was no foundation at
all for the stories of the escape of Croesus, the murder of the son
of Prexaspes, and the execution in Egypt on a trivial charge of twelve
noble Persians. His own people called Cambyses a "despot" or "master,"
in contrast with Cyrus, whom they regarded as a "father," because, as
Herodotus says, he was "harsh and reckless," whereas his father was
mild and beneficent. Further, there was the religious aspect of the
revolution, which had taken place, in the background. Cambyses may have
known that in the ranks of his army there was much sympathy with Magism,
and may have doubted whether, if the whole conspiracy were laid bare,
he could count on anything like a general adhesion of his troops to the
Zoroastrian cause. These various grounds, taken together, go far
towards accounting for a suicide which at first sight strikes us as
extraordinary, and is indeed almost unparalleled.
</p>
<p>
Of the general character of Cambyses little more need be said. He
was brave, active, and energetic, like his father: but he lacked his
father's strategic genius, his prudence, and his fertility in resources.
Born in the purple, he was proud and haughty, careless of the feelings
of others, and impatient of admonition or remonstrance. His pride made
him obstinate in error; and his contempt of others led on naturally
to harshness, and perhaps even to cruelty. He is accused of "habitual
drunkenness," and was probably not free from the intemperance which
was a common Persian failing; but there is not sufficient ground for
believing that his indulgence was excessive, much less that it proceeded
to the extent of affecting his reason. The "madness of Cambyses,"
reported to and believed in by Herodotus, was a fiction of the Egyptian
priests, who wished it to be thought that their gods had in this way
punished his impiety. The Persians had no such tradition, but merely
regarded him as unduly severe and selfish. A dispassionate consideration
of all the evidence on the subject leads to the conclusion that Cambyses
lived and died in the possession of his reason, having neither destroyed
it through inebriety nor lost it by the judgment of Heaven.
</p>
<p>
The death of Cambyses (B.C. 522) left the conspirators, who had
possession of the capital, at liberty to develop their projects, and
to take such steps as they thought best for the consolidation and
perpetuation of their power. The position which they occupied was one
of peculiar delicacy. On the one hand, the impostor had to guard against
acting in any way which would throw suspicion on his being really
Smerdis, the son of Cyrus. On the other, he had to satisfy the Magian
priests, to whom he was well known, and on whom he mainly depended for
support, if his imposture should be detected. These priests must have
desired a change of the national religion, and to effect this must have
been the true aim and object of the revolution. But it was necessary to
proceed with the utmost caution. An open proclamation that Magism was
to supersede Zoroastrianism would have seemed a strange act in an
Achaemenian prince, and could scarcely have failed to arouse doubts
which might easily terminate in discovery. The Magian brothers shrank
from affronting this peril, and resolved, before approaching it, to
obtain for the new government an amount of general popularity which
would make its overthrow in fair fight difficult. Accordingly the new
reign was inaugurated by a general remission of tribute and military
service for the space of three years&mdash;a measure which was certain to
give satisfaction to all the tribes and nations of the Empire, except
the Persians. Persia Proper was at all times exempt from tribute, and
was thus, so far, unaffected by the boon granted, while military service
was no doubt popular with the ruling nation, for whose benefit the
various conquests were effected. Still Persia could scarcely take
umbrage at an inactivity which was to last only three years, while
to the rest of the Empire the twofold grace accorded must have been
thoroughly acceptable.
</p>
<p>
Further to confirm his uncertain hold upon the throne, the
Pseudo-Smerdis took to wife all the widows of his predecessor. This is
a practice common in the East; and there can be no doubt that it gives a
new monarch a certain prestige in the eyes of his people. In the present
case, however, it involved a danger. The wives of the late king were
likely to be acquainted with the person of the king's brother; Atossa,
at any rate, could not fail to know him intimately. If the Magus allowed
them to associate together freely, according to the ordinary practice,
they would detect his imposture and probably find a way to divulge it.
He therefore introduced a new system into the seraglio. Instead of the
free intercourse one with another which the royal consorts had enjoyed
previously, he established at once the principle of complete isolation.
Each wife was assigned her own portion of the palace; and no visiting
of one wife by another was permitted. Access to them from without was
altogether forbidden, even to their nearest relations; and the wives
were thus cut off wholly from the external world, unless they could
manage to communicate with it by means of secret messages. But
precautions of this kind, though necessary, were in themselves
suspicious; they naturally suggested an inquiry into their cause and
object. It was a possible explanation of them that they proceeded from
an extreme and morbid jealousy; but the thought could not fail to occur
to some that they might be occasioned by the fear of detection.
</p>
<p>
However, as time went on, and no discovery was actually made, the Magus
grew bolder, and ventured to commence that reformation of religion which
he and his order had so much at heart. He destroyed the Zoroastrian
temples in various places, and seems to have put down the old worship,
with its hymns in praise of the Zoroastrian deities. He instituted
Magian rites in lieu of the old ceremonies, and established his
brother Magians as the priest-caste of the Persian nation. The changes
introduced were no doubt satisfactory to the Medes, and to many of
the subject races throughout the Empire. They were even agreeable to a
portion of the Persian people, who leant towards a more material worship
and a more gorgeous ceremonial than had contented their ancestors. If
the faithful worshippers of Ormazd saw them with dismay, they were too
timid to resist, and tacitly acquiesced in the religious revolution.
</p>
<p>
In one remote province the change gave a fresh impulse to a religious
struggle which was there going on, adding strength to the side of
intolerance. The Jews had now been engaged for fifteen or sixteen years
in the restoration of their temple, according to the permission granted
them by Cyrus. Their enterprise was distasteful to the neighboring
Samaritans, who strained every nerve to prevent its being brought to a
successful issue, and as each new king mounted the Persian throne,
made a fresh effort to have the work stopped by authority. Their
representations had had no effect upon Cambyses; but when they were
repeated on the accession of the Pseudo-Smerdis, the result was
different. An edict was at once sent down to Palestine, reversing the
decree of Cyrus, and authorizing the inhabitants of Samaria to interfere
forcibly in the matter, and compel the Jews to desist from building.
Armed with this decree, the Samaritan authorities hastened to Jerusalem,
and "made the Jews to cease by force and power."
</p>
<p>
These revelations of a leaning towards a creed diverse from that of the
Achaemenian princes, combined with the system of seclusion adopted in
the palace&mdash;a system not limited to the seraglio, but extending also
to the person of the monarch, who neither quitted the palace precincts
himself, nor allowed any of the Persian nobles to enter them&mdash;must have
turned the suspicions previously existing into a general belief and
conviction that the monarch seated on the throne was not Smerdis the son
of Cyrus, but an impostor. Yet still there was for a while no outbreak.
It mattered nothing to the provincials who ruled them, provided that
order was maintained, and that the boons granted them at the opening of
the new reign were not revoked or modified. Their wishes were no doubt
in favor of the prince who had remitted their burthens; and in Media a
peculiar sympathy would exist towards one who had exalted Magism. Such
discontent as was felt would be confined to Persia, or to Persia and a
few provinces of the north-east, where the Zoroastrian faith may have
maintained itself.
</p>
<p>
At last, among the chief Persians, rumors began to arise. These were
sternly repressed at the outset, and a reign of terror was established,
during which men remained silent through fear. But at length some of
the principal nobles, convinced of the imposture, held secret council
together, and discussed the measures proper to be adopted under the
circumstances. Nothing, however, was done until the arrival at the
capital of a personage felt by all to be the proper leader of the nation
in the existing crisis. This was Darius, the son of Hystaspes, a
prince of the blood royal who probably stood in the direct line of the
succession, failing the issue of Cyrus. At the early age of twenty he
had attracted the attention of that monarch, who suspected him even then
of a design to seize the throne. He was now about twenty-eight years
of age, and therefore at a time of life suited for vigorous enterprise;
which was probably the reason why his father, Hystaspes, who was still
alive, sent him to the capital, instead of proceeding thither in person.
Youth and vigor were necessary qualifications for success in a struggle
against the holders of power; and Hystaspes no longer possessed those
advantages. He therefore yielded to his son that headship of the
movement to which his position would have entitled him; and, with the
leadership in danger, he yielded necessarily his claim to the first
place, when the time of peril should be past and the rewards of victory
should come to be apportioned.
</p>
<p>
Darius, on his arrival at the capital, was at once accepted as head of
the conspiracy, and with prudent boldness determined on pushing matters
to an immediate decision. Overruling the timidity of a party among the
conspirators, who urged delay, he armed his partisans, and proceeded,
without a moment's pause, to the attack. According to the Greek
historians, he and his friends entered the palace in a body, and
surprised the Magus in his private apartments, where they slew him
after a brief struggle. But the authority of Darius discredits the Greek
accounts, and shows us, though with provoking brevity, that the course
of events must have been very different. The Magus was not slain in the
privacy of his palace, at Susa or Ecbatana, but met his death in a small
and insignificant fort in the part of Media called "the Maesan plain,"
or, more briefly, "Nisaea," whither he appears to have fled with a band
of followers. Whether he was first attacked in the capital, and escaping
threw himself into this stronghold, or receiving timely warning of his
danger withdrew to it before the outbreak occurred, or merely happened
to be at the spot when the conspirators decided to make their attempt,
we have no means of determining. We only know that the scene of the
last struggle was Sictachotes, in Media; that Darius made the attack
accompanied by six Persian nobles of high rank; and that the contest
terminated in the slaughter of the Magus and of a number of his
adherents, who were involved in the fall of their master.
</p>
<p>
Nor did the vengeance of the successful conspirators stop here.
Speeding to the capital, with the head of the Magus in their hands, and
exhibiting everywhere this proof at once of the death of the late king
and of his imposture, they proceeded to authorize and aid in carrying
out, a general massacre of the Magian priests, the abettors of the later
usurpation. Every Magus who could be found was poniarded by the enraged
Persians; and the caste would have been well-nigh exterminated, if it
had not been for the approach of night. Darkness brought the carnage
to an end; and the sword, once sheathed, was not again drawn. Only, to
complete the punishment of the ambitious religionists who had insulted
and deceived the nation, the day of the massacre was appointed to be
kept annually as a solemn festival, under the name of the Magophonia;
and a law was passed that on that day no Magus should leave his house.
</p>
<p>
The accession of Darius to the vacant throne now took place (Jan. 1,
B.C. 521). According to Herodotus it was preceded by a period of debate
and irresolution, during which the royal authority was, as it were, in
commission among the Seven; and in this interval he places not only the
choice of a king, but an actual discussion on the subject of the proper
form of government to be established. Even his contemporaries, however,
could see that this last story was unworthy of credit and it may be
questioned whether any more reliance ought to be placed on the remainder
of the narrative. Probably the true account of the matter is, that,
having come to a knowledge of the facts of the case, the heads of the
seven great Persian clans or families met together in secret conclave
and arranged all their proceedings beforehand. No government but the
monarchical could be thought of for a moment, and no one could assert
any claim to be king but Darius. Darius went into the conspiracy as a
pretender to the throne: the other six were simply his "faithful men,"
his friends and well-wishers. While, however, the six were far from
disputing Darius's right, they required and received for themselves a
guarantee of certain privileges, which may either have belonged to them
previously, by law or custom, as the heads of the great clans, or may
have been now for the first time conceded. The king-bound himself to
choose his wives from among the families of the conspirators only, and
sanctioned their claim to have free access to his person at all times
without asking his permission. One of their number, Otanes, demanded and
obtained even more. He and his house were to remain "free," and were to
receive yearly a magnificent kaftan, or royal present. Thus, something
like a check on unbridled despotism was formally and regularly
established; an hereditary nobility was acknowledged; the king became
to some extent dependent on his grandees; he could not regard himself as
the sole fountain of honor; six great nobles stood round the throne
as its supports; but their position was so near the monarch that they
detracted somewhat from his prestige and dignity.
</p>
<p>
The guarantee of these privileges was, we may be sure, given, and the
choice of Darius as king made, before the attack upon the. Magus began.
It would have been madness to allow an interval of anarchy. When
Darius reached the capital, with the head of the Pseudo-Smerdis in his
possession, he no doubt proceeded at once to the palace and took his
seat upon the vacant throne. No opposition was offered to him. The
Persians gladly saw a scion of their old royal stock installed in power.
The provincials were too far off to interfere. Such malcontents as
might be present would be cowed by the massacre that was going on in the
streets. The friends and intimates of the fallen monarch would be only
anxious to escape notice. The reign of the new king no doubt commenced
amid those acclamations which are never wanting in the East when a
sovereign first shows himself to his subjects.
</p>
<p>
The measures with which the new monarch inaugurated his reign had for
their object the re-establishment of the old worship. He rebuilt the
Zoroastrian temples which the Magus had destroyed, and probably restored
the use of the sacred chants and the other accustomed ceremonies. It may
be suspected that his religious zeal proceeded often to the length of
persecution, and that the Magian priests were not the only persons who,
under the orders which he issued, felt the weight of the secular arm.
His Zoroastrian zeal was soon known through the provinces; and the Jews
forthwith resumed the building of their temple, trusting that their
conduct would be consonant with his wishes. This trust was not
misplaced: for, when the Samaritans once more interfered and tried to
induce the new king to put a stop to the work, the only result was
a fresh edict, confirming the old decree of Cyrus, forbidding
interference, and assigning a further grant of money, cattle,
corn, etc., from the royal stores, for the furtherance of the pious
undertaking. Its accomplishment was declared to be for the advantage of
the king and his house, since, when the temple was finished, sacrifices
would be offered in it to "the God of Heaven," and prayer would be made
"for the life of the king and of his sons." Such was the sympathy which
still united pure Zoroastrianism with the worship of Jehovah. But the
reign, which, so far, might have seemed to be auspiciously begun,
was destined ere long to meet opposition, and even to encounter armed
hostility, in various quarters. In the loosely organized empires of
the early type, a change of sovereign, especially if accompanied
by revolutionary violence, is always regarded as an opportunity for
rebellion. Doubt as to the condition of the capital paralyzes the
imperial authority in the provinces; and bold men, taking advantage
of the moment of weakness, start up in various places, asserting
independence, and seeking to obtain for themselves kingdoms out of
the chaos which they see around them. The more remote provinces are
especially liable to be thus affected, and often revolt successfully on
such an occasion. It appears that the circumstances under which Darius
obtained the throne were more than usually provocative of the spirit
of disaffection and rebellion. Not only did the governors of remote
countries, like Egypt and Lydia, assume an attitude incompatible with
their duty as subjects, but everywhere, even in the very heart of the
Empire, insurrection raised its head; and for six long years the new
king was constantly employed in reducing one province after another to
obedience. Susiana, Babylonia, Persia itself, Media, Assyria, Armenia,
Hyrcania, Parthia, Margiana, Sagartia, and Sacia, all revolted during
this space, and were successively chastised and recovered. It may
be suspected that the religious element entered into some of these
struggles, and that the unusual number of the revolts and the obstinate
character of many of them were connected with the downfall of Magism and
the restoration of the pure Zoroastrian faith, which Darius was bent on
effecting. But this explanation can only be applied partially. We must
suppose, besides, a sort of contagion of rebellion&mdash;an awakening of
hopes, far and wide, among the subject nations, as the rumor that
serious troubles had broken out reached them, and a resolution to take
advantage of the critical state of things, spreading rapidly from one
people to another.
</p>
<p>
A brief sketch of these various revolts must now be given. They
commenced with a rising in Susiana, where a certain Atrines assumed
the name and state of king, and was supported by the people. Almost
simultaneously a pretender appeared in Babylon, who gave out that he was
the son of the late king, Nabonidus, and bore the world-renowned name
of Nebuchadnezzar. Darius, regarding this second revolt as the more
important of the two, while he dispatched a force to punish the
Susianians, proceeded in person against the Babylonian pretender. The
rivals met at the river Tigris, which the Babylonians held with a naval
force, while their army was posted on the right bank, ready to dispute
the passage. Darius, however, crossed the river in their dispute, and,
defeating the troops of his antagonist, pressed forward against the
capital. He had nearly reached it, when the pretender gave him battle
for the second time at a small town on the banks of the Euphrates.
Fortune again declared in favor of the Persians, who drove the host of
their enemy into the water and destroyed great numbers. The soi-disant
Nebuchadnezzar escaped with a few horsemen and threw himself into
Babylon; but the city was ill prepared for a siege, and was soon taken,
the pretender falling into the hands of his enemy, who caused him to be
executed.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, in Susiana, Atrines, the original leader of the rebellion,
had been made prisoner by the troops sent against him, and, being
brought to Darius while he was on his march against Babylon, was put to
death. But this severity had little effect. A fresh leader appeared in
the person of a certain Martes, a Persian who, taking example from the
Babylonian rebel, assumed a name which connected him with the old kings
of the country, and probably claimed to be their descendant, but the
hands of Darius were now free by the termination of the Babylonian
contest, and he was able to proceed towards Susiana himself. This
movement, apparently, was unexpected; for when the Susianians heard of
it they were so alarmed that they laid hands on the pretender and slew
him.
</p>
<p>
A more important rebellion followed. Three of the chief provinces of
the empire, Media, Armenia, and Assyria, revolted in concert. A Median
monarch was set up, who called himself Xathrites, and claimed descent
from the great Oyaxares; and it would seem that the three countries
immediately acknowledged his sway. Darius, seeing how formidable the
revolt was, determined to act with caution. Settling himself at the
newly-conquered city of Babylon, he resolved to employ his generals
against the rebels, and in this way to gauge the strength of the
outbreak, before adventuring his own person into the fray. Hydarnes,
one of the Seven conspirators, was sent into Media with an army, while
Dadarses, an Armenian, was dispatched into Armenia, and Vomises, a
Persian, was ordered to march through Assyria into the same country.
All three generals were met by the forces of the pretender, and several
battles were fought, with results that seem not to have been very
decisive. Darius claims the victory on each occasion for his own
generals; but it is evident that his arms made little progress, and
that, in spite of several small defeats, the rebellion maintained a bold
front, and was thought not unlikely to be successful. So strong was
this feeling that two of the eastern provinces, Hyrcania and Parthia,
deserted the Persian cause in the midst of the struggle, and placed
themselves under the rule of Xathrites. Either this circumstance, or the
general position of affairs, induced Darius at length to take the field
in person. Quitting Babylon, he marched into Media, and being met by the
pretender near a town called Kudrus, he defeated him in a great battle.
This is no doubt the engagement of which Herodotus speaks, and which he
rightly regards as decisive. The battle of Kudrus gave Ecbatana into the
hands of Darius, and made the Median prince an outcast and a fugitive.
He fled towards the East, probably intending to join his partisans in
Hyrcania and Parthia, but was overtaken in the district of Rhages and
made prisoner by the troops of Darius. The king treated his captive with
extreme severity. Having cut off his nose, ears, and tongue, he kept
him for some time chained to the door of his palace, in order that there
might be no doubt of his capture. When this object had been sufficiently
secured, the wretched sufferer was allowed to end his miserable
existence. He was crucified in his capital city, Ecbatana, before the
eyes of those who had seen his former glory.
</p>
<p>
The rebellion was thus crushed in its original seat, but it had still to
be put down in the countries whereto it had extended itself. Parthia
and Hyrcania, which had embraced the cause of the pretender, were still
maintaining a conflict with their former governor, Hystaspes, Darius's
father. Darius marched as far as Rhages to his father's assistance, and
dispatched from that point a body of Persian troops to reinforce him.
With this important aid Hystaspes once more gave the rebels battle, and
succeeded in defeating them so entirely that they presently made their
submission.
</p>
<p>
Troubles, meanwhile, had broken out in Sagartia. A native chief, moved
probably by the success which had for a while attended the Median rebel
who claimed to rule as the descendant and representative of Cyaxares,
came forward with similar pretensions, and was accepted by the
Sargartians as their monarch. This revolt, however, proved unimportant.
Darius suppressed it with the utmost facility by means of a mixed
army of Persians and Medes, whom he placed under a Median leader,
Tachamaspates. The pretender was captured and treated almost exactly
in the same way as the Mede whose example he had followed. His nose and
ears were cut off; he was chained for a while at the palace door; and
finally he was crucified at Arbela.
</p>
<p>
Another trifling revolt occurred about the same time in Margiana. The
Margians rebelled and set up a certain Phraates, a native, to be their
king. But the satrap of Bactria, within whose province Margiana lay,
quelled the revolt almost immediately.
</p>
<p>
Hitherto, however thickly troubles had come upon him, Darius could have
the satisfaction of feeling that he was contending with foreigners,
and that his own nation at any rate was faithful and true. But now
this consolation was to be taken from him. During his absence in
the provinces of the north-east Persia itself revolted against his
authority, and acknowledged for king an impostor, who, undeterred by the
fate of Gomates, and relying on the obscurity which still hung over
the end of the real Smerdis, assumed his name, and claimed to be the
legitimate occupant of the throne. The Persians at home were either
deceived a second time, or were willing to try a change of ruler; but
the army of Darius, composed of Persians and Medes, adhered to the
banner under which they had so often marched to victory, and enabled
Darius, after a struggle of some duration, to re-establish his sway.
The impostor suffered two defeats at the hands of Artabardes, one
of Darius's generals, while a force which he had detached to excite
rebellion in Arachosia was engaged by the satrap of that province and
completely routed. The so-called Smerdis was himself captured, and
suffered the usual penalty of unsuccessful revolt, crucifixion.
</p>
<p>
Before, however, these results were accomplished&mdash;while the fortune of
war still hung in the balance&mdash;a fresh danger threatened. Encouraged
by the disaffection which appeared to be so general, and which had at
length reached the very citadel of the Empire, Babylon revolted for the
second time. A man, named Aracus, an Armenian by descent, but settled
in Babylonia, headed the insurrection, and, adopting the practice
of personation so usual at the time, assumed the name and style of
"Nebuchadnezzar, son of Nabonidus." Less alarmed on this occasion than
at the time of the first revolt, the king was content to send a
Median general against the new pretender. This officer, who is called
Intaphres, speedily chastised the rebels, capturing Babylon, and taking
Aracus prisoner. Crucifixion was again the punishment awarded to the
rebel leader.
</p>
<p>
A season of comparative tranquillity seems now to have set in; and it
may have been in this interval that Darius found time to chastise
the remoter governors, who without formally declaring themselves
independent, or assuming the title of king, had done acts savoring of
rebellion. Oroetes, the governor of Sardis, who had comported himself
strangely even under Cambyses, having ventured to entrap and put to
death an ally of that monarch's, Polycrates of Samos, had from the
time of the Magian revolution assumed an attitude quite above that of a
subject. Having a quarrel with Mitrobates, the governor of a neighboring
province, he murdered him and annexed his territory. When Darius sent a
courier to him with a message the purport of which he disliked, he set
men to waylay and assassinate him. It was impossible to overlook such
acts; and Darius must have sent an army into Asia Minor, if one of
his nobles had not undertaken to remove Oroetes in another way. Arming
himself with several written orders bearing the king's seal, he went
to Sardis, and gradually tried the temper of the guard which the satrap
kept round his person. When he found them full of respect for the royal
authority and ready to do whatever the king commanded, he produced
an order for the governor's execution, which they carried into effect
immediately.
</p>
<p>
The governor of Egypt, Aryandes, had shown a guilty ambition in a more
covert way. Understanding that Darius had issued a gold coinage of
remarkable purity, he, on his own authority and without consulting the
king, issued a silver coinage of a similar character. There is reason to
believe that he even placed his name upon his coins; an act which to
the Oriental mind distinctly implied a claim of independent sovereignty.
Darius taxed him with a design to revolt, and put him to death on the
charge, apparently without exciting any disturbance.
</p>
<p>
Still, however, the Empire was not wholly tranquillized. A revolt in
Susiana, suppressed by the conspirator Gobryas, and another among the
Sacse of the Tigris, quelled by Darius in person, are recorded on the
rock of Behistun, in a supplementary portion of the Inscription. We
cannot date, unless it be by approximation, these various troubles; but
there is reason to believe that they were almost all contained within
a space not exceeding five or six years. The date of the Behistun
Inscription is fixed by internal evidence to about B.C. 516-515&mdash;in
other words, to the fifth or sixth year of the reign of Darius. Its
erection seems to mark the termination of the first period of the reign,
or that of disturbance, and the commencement of the second period, or
that of tranquillity, internal progress, and patronage of the fine arts
by the monarch.
</p>
<p>
It was natural that Darius, having with so much effort and difficulty
reduced the revolted provinces to obedience, should proceed to consider
within himself how the recurrence of such a time of trouble might be
prevented. His experience had shown him how weak were the ties which had
hitherto been thought sufficient to hold the Empire together, and how
slight an obstacle they opposed to the tendency, which all great empires
have, to disruption. But, however natural it might be to desire a remedy
for the evils which afflicted the State, it was not easy to devise one.
Great empires had existed in Western Asia for above seven hundred years,
and had all suffered more or less from the same inherent weakness; but
no one had as yet invented a cure, or even (so far as appears) conceived
the idea of improving on the rude system of imperial sway which the
first conqueror had instituted. It remained for Darius, not only to
desire, but to design&mdash;not only to design, but to bring into action&mdash;an
entirely new form and type of government. He has been well called "the
true founder of the Persian state." He found the Empire a crude and
heterogeneous mass of ill-assorted elements, hanging loosely together by
the single tie of subjection to a common head; he left it a compact
and regularly organized body, united on a single well-ordered system,
permanently established everywhere.
</p>
<p>
On the nature and details of this system it will be necessary to speak
at some length. It was the first, and probably the best, instance of
that form of government which, taking its name from the Persian word
for provincial ruler, is known generally as the system of "satrapial"
administration. Its main principles were, in the first place, the
reduction of the whole Empire to a quasi-uniformity by the substitution
of one mode of governing for several; secondly, the substitution of
fixed and definite burthens on the subject in lieu of variable and
uncertain calls; and thirdly, the establishment of a variety of checks
and counterpoises among the officials to whom it was necessary that the
crown should delegate its powers, which tended greatly to the security
of the monarch and the stability of the kingdom. A consideration of the
modes in which these three principles were applied will bring before us
in a convenient form the chief points of the system.
</p>
<p>
Uniformity, or a near approach to it, was produced, not so much by the
abolition of differences as by superadding one and the same governmental
machinery in all parts of the Empire. It is an essential feature of
the satrapial system that it does not aim at destroying differences, or
assimilating to one type the various races and countries over which
it is extended. On the contrary, it allows, and indeed encourages, the
several nations to retain their languages, habits, manners, religion,
laws, and modes of local government. Only it takes care to place above
all these things a paramount state authority, which is one and the same
everywhere, whereon the unity of the kingdom is dependent. The authority
instituted by Darius was that of his satraps. He divided the whole
empire into a number of separate governments&mdash;a number which must have
varied at different times, but which seems never to have fallen short
of twenty. Over each government he placed a satrap, or supreme civil
governor, charged with the collection and transmission of the revenue,
the administration of justice, the maintenance of order, and the general
supervision of the territory. These satraps were nominated by the king
at his pleasure from any class of his subjects, and held office for no
definite term, but simply until recalled, being liable to deprivation
or death at any moment, without other formality than the presentation
of the royal firman. While, however, they remained in office they were
despotic&mdash;they represented the Great King, and were clothed with a
portion of his majesty&mdash;they had palaces, Courts, body-guards, parks
or "paradises," vast trains of eunuchs and attendants, well-filled,
seraglios. They wielded the power of life and death. They assessed the
tribute on the several towns and villages within their jurisdiction
at their pleasure, and appointed deputies&mdash;called sometimes, like
themselves, satraps&mdash;over cities or districts within their province,
whose office was regarded as one of great dignity. They exacted from
the provincials, for their own support and that of their Court, over and
above the tribute due to the crown, whatever sum they regarded them as
capable of furnishing. Favors, and even justice, had to be purchased
from them by gifts. They were sometimes guilty of gross outrages on the
persons and honor of their subjects. Nothing restrained their tyranny
but such sense of right as they might happen to possess, and the fear of
removal or execution if the voice of complaint reached the monarch.
</p>
<p>
Besides this uniform civil administration, the Empire was pervaded
throughout by one and the same military system. The services of the
subject nations as soldiers were, as a general rule, declined, unless
upon rare and exceptional cases. Order was maintained by large and
numerous garrisons of foreign troops&mdash;Persians and Medes&mdash;quartered
on the inhabitants, who had little sympathy with those among whom they
lived, and would be sure to repress sternly any outbreak. All places of
much strength were occupied in this way; and special watch was kept upon
the great capitals, which were likely to be centres of disaffection.
Thus a great standing army, belonging to the conquering race, stood
everywhere on guard throughout the Empire, offending the provincials no
doubt by their pride, their violence, and their contemptuous bearing,
but rendering a native revolt under ordinary circumstances hopeless.
</p>
<p>
Some exceptions to the general uniformity had almost of necessity to be
made in so vast and heterogeneous an empire as the Persian. Occasionally
it was thought wise to allow the continuance of a native dynasty in a
province; and the satrap had in such a case to share with the native
prince a divided authority. This was certainly the case in Cilicia, and
probably in Paphlagonia and Phoenicia. Tribes also, included within
the geographical limits of a satrapy, were sometimes recognized as
independent; and petty wars were carried on between these hordes and
their neighbors. Robber bands in many places infested the mountains,
owing no allegiance to any one, and defied alike the satrap and the
standing army.
</p>
<p>
The condition of Persia Proper was also purely exceptional. Persia paid
no tribute, and was not counted as a satrapy. Its inhabitants were,
however, bound, when the king passed through their country, to bring him
gifts according to their means. This burthen may have been felt sensibly
by the rich, but it pressed very lightly on the poor, who, if they could
not afford an ox or a sheep, might bring a little milk or cheese, a
few dates, or a handful of wild fruit. On the other hand, the king was
bound, whenever he visited Pasargadae, to present to each Persian woman
who appeared before him a sum equal to twenty Attic drachmas, or about
sixteen shillings of our money. This custom commemorated the service
rendered by the sex in the battle wherein Cyrus first repulsed the
forces of Astyages.
</p>
<p>
The substitution of definite burthens on the subject in lieu of variable
and uncertain charges was aimed at, rather than effected, by the new
arrangement of the revenue which is associated with the name of Darius.
This arrangement consisted in fixing everywhere the amount of tribute
in money and in kind which each satrapy was to furnish to the crown. A
definite money payment, varying, in ordinary satrapies, from 170 to
1000 Babylonian silver talents,330 or from L42,000. to L250,000. of our
money, and amounting, in the exceptional case of the Indian satrapy, to
above a million sterling, was required annually by the sovereign,
and had to be remitted by the satrap to the capital. Besides this, a
payment, the nature and amount of which was also fixed, had to be made
in kind, each province being required to furnish that commodity, or
those commodities, for which it was most celebrated. This latter burthen
must have pressed very unequally on different portions of the Empire,
if the statement of Herodotus be true that Babylonia and Assyria paid
one-third of it. The payment seems to have been very considerable
in amount. Egypt had to supply grain sufficient for the nutriment of
120,000 Persian troops quartered in the country. Media had to contribute
100,000 sheep, 4000 mules, and 3000 horses; Cappadocia, half the above
number of each kind of animal; Armenia furnished 20,000 colts; Cilicia
gave 360 white horses and a sum of 140 talents (L35,000.) in lieu
of further tribute in kind. Babylonia, besides corn, was required to
furnish 500 boy eunuchs. These charges, however, were all fixed by the
crown, and may have been taken into consideration in assessing the money
payment, the main object of the whole arrangement evidently being to
make the taxation of each province proportionate to its wealth and
resources.
</p>
<p>
The assessment of the taxation upon the different portions of his
province was left to the satrap. We do not know on what principles he
ordinarily proceeded, or whether any uniform principles at all were
observed throughout the Empire. But we find some evidence that, in
places at least, the mode of exaction and collection was by a land-tax.
The assessment upon individuals, and the actual collection from them,
devolved, in all probability, on the local authorities, who distributed
the burthen imposed upon their town, village, or district as they
thought proper. Thus the foreign oppressor did not come into direct
contact with the mass of the conquered people, who no doubt paid the
calls made upon them with less reluctance through the medium of their
own proper magistrates.
</p>
<p>
If the taxation of the subject had stopped here, he would have had
no just ground of complaint against his rulers. The population of the
Empire cannot be estimated at less than forty millions of souls. The
highest estimate of the value of the entire tribute, both in money and
kind, will scarcely place it at more than ten millions sterling. Thus
far, then, the burthen of taxation would certainly not have exceeded
five shillings a head per annum. Perhaps it would not have reached half
that amount. But, unhappily, neither was the tribute the sole tax which
the crown exacted from its subjects, nor had the crown the sole right
of exacting taxation. Persian subjects in many parts of the Empire paid,
besides their tribute, a water-rate, which is expressly said to have
been very productive. The rivers of the Empire were the king's; and when
water was required for irrigation, a state officer superintended the
opening of the sluices, and regulated the amount of the precious fluid
which might be drawn off by each tribe or township. For the opening of
the sluices a large sum was paid to the officer, which found its way
into the coffers of the state. Further, it appears that such things
as fisheries&mdash;and if so, probably salt-works, mines, quarries, and
forests&mdash;were regarded as crown property, and yielded large sums to the
revenue. They appear to have been farmed to responsible persons, who
undertook to pay at a certain fixed rate, and made what profit they
could by the transaction. The price of commodities thus farmed would be
greatly enhanced to the consumer.
</p>
<p>
By these means the actual burthen of taxation upon the subject was
rendered to some extent uncertain and indefinite, and the benefits of
the fixed tribute system were diminished. But the chief drawback upon
it has still to be mentioned. While the claims of the crown upon its
subjects were definite and could not be exceeded, the satrap was at
liberty to make any exactions that he pleased beyond them. There
is every reason to believe that he received no stipend, and that,
consequently, the burthen of supporting him, his body-guard, and his
Court was intended to fall on the province which had the benefit of his
superintendence. Like a Roman proconsul, he was to pay himself out of
the pockets of his subjects; and, like that class of persons, he took
care to pay himself highly. It has been calculated that one satrap of
Babylon drew from his province annually in actual coin a sum equal to
L100,000. of our money. We can scarcely doubt that the claims made by
the provincial governors were, on the average, at least equal to
those of the crown; and they had the disadvantage of being irregular,
uncertain, and purely arbitrary.
</p>
<p>
Thus, what was gained by the new system was not so much the relief of
the subject from uncertain taxation as the advantage to the crown of
knowing beforehand what the revenue would be, and being able to regulate
its expenditure accordingly. Still a certain amount of benefit did
undoubtedly accrue to the provincials from the system; since it gave
them the crown for their protector. So long as the payments made to the
state were irregular, it was, or at least seemed to be, for the interest
of the crown to obtain from each province as much as it could anyhow
pay. When the state dues were once fixed, as the crown gained nothing by
the rapacity of its officers, but rather lost, since the province became
exhausted, it was interested in checking greed, and seeing that the
provinces were administered by wise and good satraps.
</p>
<p>
The control of its great officers is always the main difficulty of a
despotic government, when it is extended over a large space of territory
and embraces many millions of men. The system devised by Darius for
checking and controlling his satraps was probably the best that has
ever yet been brought into operation. His plan was to establish in every
province at least three officers holding their authority directly from
the crown, and only responsible to it, who would therefore act as checks
one upon another. These were the satrap, the military commandant, and
the secretary. The satrap was charged with the civil administration, and
especially with the department of finance. The commandant was supreme
over the troops. The office of the secretary is less clearly defined;
but it probably consisted mainly in keeping the Court informed by
despatches of all that went on in the province. Thus, if the satrap
were inclined to revolt, he had, in the first place, to persuade the
commandant, who would naturally think that, if he ran the risk, it might
as well be for himself; and, further, he had to escape the lynx eyes of
the secretary, whose general right of superintendence gave him entrance
everywhere, and whose prospects of advancement would probably depend a
good deal upon the diligence and success with which he discharged the
office of "King's Eye" and "Ear." So, if the commandant were ambitious
of independent sway, he must persuade the satrap, or he would have no
money to pay his troops; and he too must blind the secretary, or else
bribe him into silence. As for the secretary, having neither men
nor money at his command, it was impossible that he should think of
rebellion.
</p>
<p>
But the precautions taken against revolt did not end here. Once a year,
according to Xenophon, or more probably at irregular intervals, an
officer came suddenly down from the Court with a commission to inspect
a province. Such persons were frequently of royal rank, brothers or sons
of the king. They were accompanied by an armed force, and were empowered
to correct whatever was amiss in the province, and in case of necessity
to report to the crown the insubordination or incompetency of its
officers. If this system had been properly maintained, it is evident
that it would have acted as a most powerful check upon misgovernment,
and would have rendered revolt almost impossible.
</p>
<p>
Another mode by which it was sought to secure the fidelity of the
satraps and commandants was by choosing them from among the king's blood
relations, or else attaching them to the crown by marriage with one of
the princesses. It was thought that the affection of sons and brothers
would be a restraint upon their ambition, and that even connections by
marriage would feel that they had an interest in upholding the power and
dignity of the great house with which they had been thought worthy of
alliance. This system, which was entensively followed by Darius, had on
the whole good results, and was at any rate preferable to that barbarous
policy of prudential fratricide which has prevailed widely in Oriental
governments.
</p>
<p>
The system of checks, while it was effectual for the object at which it
specially aimed, had one great disadvantage. It weakened the hands of
authority in times of difficulty. When danger, internal or external,
threatened, it was an evil that the powers of government should be
divided, and the civil authority lodged in the hands of one officer, the
military in those of another. Concentration of power is needed for rapid
and decisive action, for unity of purpose, and secrecy both of plan and
of execution. These considerations led to a modification of the original
idea of satrapial government, which was adopted partially at first&mdash;in
provinces especially exposed to danger, internal or external&mdash;but which
ultimately became almost universal. The offices of satrap, or civil
administrator, and commandant, or commander of the troops, were vested
in the same person, who came in this way to have that full and complete
authority which is possessed by Turkish pashas and modern Persian
khans or beys&mdash;an authority practically uncontrolled. This system was
advantageous for the defence of a province against foes; but it was
dangerous to the stability of the Empire, since it led naturally to the
occurrence of formidable rebellions.
</p>
<p>
Two minor points in the scheme of Darius remain to be noticed, before
this account of his governmental system can be regarded as complete.
These are his institution of posts, and his coinage of money.
</p>
<p>
In Darius's idea of government was included rapidity of communication.
Regarding it as of the utmost importance that the orders of the Court
should be speedily transmitted to the provincial governors, and that
their reports and those of the royal secretaries should be received
without needless delay, he established along the lines of routes already
existing between the chief cities of the Empire a number of post-houses,
placed at regular intervals, according to the estimated capacity of a
horse to gallop at his best speed without stopping. At each post-house
were maintained, at the cost of the state, a number of couriers and
several relays of horses. When a despatch was to be forwarded it was
taken to the first post-house along the route, where a courier received
it, and immediately mounting on horseback galloped with it to the next
station. Here it was delivered to a new courier, who, mounted on a fresh
horse, took it the next stage on its journey; and thus it passed from
hand to hand till it reached its destination. According to Xenophon, the
messengers travelled by night as well as by day; and the conveyance was
so rapid that some even compared it to the flight of birds. Excellent
inns or caravanserais were to be found at every station; bridges or
ferries were established upon all the streams; guard-houses occurred
here and there, and the whole route was kept secure from the brigands
who infested the Empire. Ordinary travellers were glad to pursue so
convenient a line of march; it does not appear, however, that they could
obtain the use of post-horses even when the government was in no need
of them. The coinage of Darius consisted, it is probable, both of a gold
and silver issue. It is not perhaps altogether certain that he was
the first king of Persia who coined money; but, if the term "daric" is
really derived from his name, that alone would be a strong argument in
favor of his claim to priority. In any case, it is indisputable that
he was the first Persian king who coined on a large scale, and it is
further certain that his gold coinage was regarded in later times as of
peculiar value on account of its purity. His gold darics appear to have
contained, on an average, not quite 124 grains of pure metal, which
would make their value about twenty two shillings of our money.
They were of the type usual at the time both in Lydia and in
Greece&mdash;flattened lumps of metal, very thick in comparison with the size
of their surface, irregular, and rudely stamped. The silver darics
were similar in general character, but exceeded the gold in size. Their
weight was from 224 to 230 grains, and they would thus have been worth
not quite three shillings of our money. It does not appear that any
other kinds of coins besides these were ever issued from the Persian
mint. They must, therefore, it would seem, have satisfied the commercial
needs of the people.
</p>
<p>
From this review of the governmental system of Darius we must now return
to the actions of his later life. The history of an Oriental monarchy
must always be composed mainly of a series of biographies; for, as the
monarch is all in all in such communities, his sayings, doings, and
character, not only determine, but constitute, the annals of the State.
In the second period of his reign, that which followed on the time of
trouble and disturbance, Darius (as has been already observed)
appears to have pursued mainly the arts of peace. Bent on settling and
consolidating his Empire, he set up everywhere the satrapial form of
government, organized and established his posts, issued his coinage,
watched over the administration of justice, and in various ways
exhibited a love of order and method, and a genius for systematic
arrangement. At the same time he devoted considerable attention to
ornamental and architectural works, to sculpture, and to literary
composition. He founded the royal palace at Susa, which was the main
residence of the later kings. At Persepolis he certainly erected one
very important building; and it is on the whole most probable that he
designed&mdash;if he did not live to execute&mdash;the Chehl Minor itself&mdash;the
chief of the magnificent structures upon the great central platform. The
massive platform itself, with its grand and stately steps, is certainly
of his erection, for it is inscribed with his name. He gave his works
all the solidity and strength that is derivable from the use of huge
blocks of a good hard material. He set the example of ornamenting the
stepped approached to a palace with elaborate bas-reliefs. He designed
and caused to be constructed in his own lifetime the rock-tomb at
Nakhsh-i-Rustam, in which his remains were afterwards laid. The
rock-sculpture at Behistun was also his work. In attention to the
creation of permanent historical records he excelled all the Persian
kings, both before him and after him. The great Inscription of Behistun
has no parallel in ancient times for length, finish, and delicacy
of execution, unless it be in Assyria or in Egypt. The only really
historical inscription at Persepolis is one set up by Darius. He was the
only Persian king, except perhaps one, who placed an inscription upon
his tomb. The later monarchs in their records do little more than repeat
certain religious phrases and certain forms of self-glorification which
occur in the least remarkable inscriptions of their great predecessor.
He alone oversteps those limits, and presents us with geographical
notices and narratives of events profoundly interesting to the
historian.
</p>
<p>
During this period of comparative peace, which may have extended
from about B.C. 516 to B.C. 508 or 507, the general tranquillity was
interrupted by at least one important expedition. The administrational
merits of Darius are so great that they have obscured his military
glories, and have sent him down to posterity with the character of an
unwarlike monarch&mdash;if not a mere "peddler," as his subjects said, yet,
at any rate, a mere consolidator and arranger. But the son of Hystaspes
was no carpet prince. He had not drawn the sword against his domestic
foes to sheath it finally and forever when his triumph over them was
completed. On the contrary, he regarded it as incumbent on him to carry
on the aggressive policy of Cyrus and Cambyses, his great predecessors,
and like them to extend in one direction or another the boundaries of
the Empire. Perhaps he felt that aggression was the very law of the
Empire's being, since if the military spirit was once allowed to become
extinct in the conquering nation, they would lose the sole guarantee of
their supremacy. At any rate, whatever his motive, we find him, after
he had snatched a brief interval of repose, engaging in great wars
both towards his eastern and his western frontier&mdash;wars which in both
instances had results of considerable importance.
</p>
<p>
The first grand expedition was towards the East. Cyrus, as we have seen,
had extended the Persian sway over the mountains of Affghanistan and the
highlands from which flow the tributaries of the Upper Indus. From these
eminences the Persian garrisons looked down on a territory possessing
every quality that could attract a powerful conqueror. Fertile,
well-watered, rich in gold, peopled by an ingenious yet warlike race,
which would add strength no less than wealth to its subjugators, the
Punjab lay at the foot of the Sufeid Koh and Suliman ranges, inviting
the attack of those who could swoop down when they pleased upon the low
country. It was against this region that Darius directed his first great
aggressive effort. Having explored the course of the Indus from Attock
to the sea by means of boats, and obtained, we may suppose, in this way
some knowledge of the country and its inhabitants, he led or sent an
expedition into the tract, which in a short time succeeded in completely
reducing it. The Punjab, and probably the whole valley of the Indus, was
annexed, and remained subject till the later times of the Empire. The
results of this conquest were the acquisition of a brave race, capable
of making excellent soldiers, an enormous increase of the revenue, a
sudden and vast influx of gold into Persia, which led probably to the
introduction of the gold coinage, and the establishment of commercial
relations with the natives, which issued in a regular trade carried
on by coasting-vessels between the mouths of the Indus and the Persian
Gulf.
</p>
<p>
The next important expedition&mdash;one probably of still greater
magnitude&mdash;took exactly the opposite direction. The sea which bounded
the Persian dominion to the west and the north-west narrowed in two
places to dimensions not much exceeding those of of the greater Asiatic
rivers. The eye which looked across the Thracian Bosphorus or the
Hellespont seemed to itself to be merely contemplating the opposite
bank of a pretty wide stream. Darius, consequently being master of
Asia Minor, and separated by what seemed to him so poor a barrier
from fertile tracts of vast and indeed indefinite extent, such as were
nowhere else to be found on the borders of his empire, naturally turned
his thoughts of conquest to this quarter. His immediate desire was,
probably, to annex Thrace; but he may have already entertained wider
views, and have looked to embracing in his dominions the lovely isles
and coasts of Greece also, so making good the former threats of Cyrus.
The story of the voyage and escape of Democedes, related by Herodotus
with such amplitude of detail, and confirmed to some extent from other
sources, cannot be a mere myth without historical foundation. Nor is
it probable that the expedition was designed merely for the purpose of
"indulging the exile with a short visit to his native country," or of
collecting "interesting information." If by the king's orders a vessel
was fitted out at Sidon to explore the coasts of Greece under the
guidance of Democedes, which proceeded as far as Crotona in Magna
Grsecia, we may be tolerably sure that a political object lay at the
bottom of the enterprise. It would have exactly the same aim and end as
the eastern voyage of Scylax, and would be intended, like that, to pave
the way for a conquest. Darius was therefore, it would seem, already
contemplating the reduction of Greece Proper, and did not require
to have it suggested to him by any special provocation. Mentally, or
actually, surveying the map of the world, so far as it was known to
him, he saw that in this direction only there was an attractive country
readily accessible. Elsewhere his Empire abutted on seas, sandy deserts,
or at best barren steppes; here, and here only, was there a rich prize
close at hand and (as it seemed) only waiting to be grasped.
</p>
<p>
But if the aggressive force of Persia was to be turned in this
direction, if the stream of conquest was to be set westward along the
flanks of Rhodope and Haemus, it was essential to success, and even to
safety, that the line of communication with Asia should remain intact.
Now, there lay on the right flank of an army marching into Europe a vast
and formidable power, known to be capable of great efforts, which, if
allowed to feel itself secure from attack, might be expected at any
time to step in, to break the line of communication between the east
and west, and to bring the Persians who should be engaged in conquering
Pseonia, Macedonia, and Greece, into imminent danger. It is greatly to
the credit of Darius that he saw this peril&mdash;saw it and took effectual
measures to guard against it. The Scythian expedition was no insane
project of a frantic despot, burning for revenge, or ambitious of an
impossible conquest. It has all the appearance of being a well-laid
plan, conceived by a moderate and wise prince, for the furtherance of
a great design, and the permanent advantage of his empire. The lord of
South-Western Asia was well aware of the existence beyond his northern
frontier of a standing menace to his power. A century had not sufficed
to wipe out the recollection of that terrible time when Scythian hordes
had carried desolation far and wide over the fairest of the regions that
were now under the Persian dominion. What had occurred once might recur.
Possibly, as a modern author suggests, "the remembrance of ancient
injuries may have been revived by recent aggressions." It was at any
rate essential to strike terror into the hordes of the Steppe Region in
order that Western Asia might attain a sense of security. It was still
more essential to do so if the north-west was to become the scene
of war, and the Persians were to make a vigorous effort to establish
themselves permanently in Europe. Scythia, it must be remembered,
reached to the banks of the Danube. An invader, who aspired to the
conquest even of Thrace, was almost forced into collision with her next
neighbor.
</p>
<p>
Darius, having determined on his course, prefaced his expedition by a
raid, the object of which was undoubtedly to procure information. He
ordered Ariaramnes, satrap of Cappadocia, to cross the Euxine with a
small fleet, and, descending suddenly upon the Scythian coast, to carry
off a number of prisoners. Ariaramnes executed the commission skilfully,
and was so fortunate as to make prize of a native of high rank, the
brother of a Scythian chief or king. From this person and his companions
the Persian monarch was able to obtain all the information which he
required. Thus enlightened, he proceeded to make his preparations.
Collecting a fleet of 600 ships, chiefly from the Greeks of Asia, and
an army estimated at from 700,000 to 800,000 men, which was made up
of contingents from all the nations under his rule, he crossed the
Bosphorus by a bridge of boats constructed by Mandrocles a Samian;
marched through Thrace along the line of the Little Balkan, receiving
the submission of the tribes as he went; crossed the Great Balkan;
conquered the Getae, who dwelt between that range and the Danube; passed
the Danube by a bridge, which the Ionian Greeks had made with their
vessels just above the apex of the Delta; and so invaded Scythia. The
natives had received intelligence of his approach, and had resolved not
to risk a battle. They retired as he advanced, and endeavored to bring
his army into difficulties by destroying the forage, driving off the
cattle, and filling in the wells. But the commissariat of the Persians
was, as usual, well arranged. Darius remained for more than two months
in Scythia without incurring any important losses. He succeeded in
parading before the eyes of the whole nation the immense military power
of his empire. He no doubt inflicted considerable damage on the hordes,
whose herds he must often have captured, and whose supplies of forage he
curtailed. It is difficult to say how far he penetrated. Herodotus was
informed that he marched east to the Tanais (Don), and thence north to
the country of the Budini, where he burnt the staple of Gelonus, which
cannot well have been below the fiftieth parallel, and was probably
not far from Voronej. It is certainly astonishing that he should have
ventured so far inland, and still more surprising that, having done
so, he should have returned with his army well-nigh intact. But we can
scarcely suppose the story that he destroyed the staple of the Greek
trade a pure fiction. He would be glad to leave his mark in the country,
and might make an extraordinary effort to reach the only town that was
to be found in the whole steppe region. Having effected his purpose by
its destruction, he would retire, falling back probably upon the coast,
where he could obtain supplies from his fleet. It is beyond dispute that
he returned with the bulk of his army, having suffered no loss but
that of a few invalid troops whom he sacrificed. Attempts had been made
during his absence to induce the Greeks, who guarded the bridge over
the Danube, to break it, and so hinder his return; but they were
unsuccessful. Darius recrossed the river after an interval of somewhat
more than two months, victorious according to his own notions, and
regarded himself as entitled thenceforth to enumerate among the subject
races of his empire "the Scyths beyond the sea." On his return march
through Thrace, he met, apparently, with no opposition. Before passing
the Bosphorus, he gave a commission to one of his generals, a certain
Megabazus, to complete the reduction of Thrace, and assigned him for the
purpose a body of 80,000 men, who remained in Europe while Darius and
the rest of his army crossed into Asia.
</p>
<p>
Megabazus appears to have been fully worthy of the trust reposed in him.
In a single campaign (B.C. 506) he overran and subjugated the entire
tract between the Propontis and the Strymon, thus pushing forward the
Persian dominion to the borders of Macedonia. Among the tribes which he
conquered were the Perinthians, Greeks; the Pseti, Cicones, Bistones,
Sapaei, Dersaei and Edoni, Thracians; and the Paeoplae and Siripasones,
Pseonians. These last, to gratify a whim of Darius, were transported
into Asia. The Thracians who submitted were especially those of the
coast, no attempt, apparently, being made to penetrate the mountain
fastnesses and bring under subjection the tribes of the interior.
</p>
<p>
The first contact between Persia and Macedonia possesses peculiar
interest from the circumstances of the later history. An ancestor of
Alexander the Great sat upon the throne of Macedon when the general of
Darius was brought in his career of conquest to the outskirts of the
Macedonian power. The kingdom was at this time comparatively small, not
extending much beyond Mount Bermius on the one hand, and not reaching
very far to the east of the Axius on the other. Megabazus saw in it,
we may be sure, not the fated destroyer of the Empire which he was
extending, but a petty state which the mere sound of the Persian
name would awe into subjection. He therefore, instead of invading the
country, contented himself with sending an embassy, with a demand
for earth and water, the symbols, according to Persian custom, of
submission. Amyntas, the Macedonian king, consented, to the demand
at once; and though, owing to insolent conduct on the part of the
ambassadors, they were massacred with their whole retinue, yet this
circumstance did not prevent the completion of Macedonian vassalage.
When a second embassy was sent to inquire into the fate of the first,
Alexander, the son of Amyntas, who had arranged the massacre, contrived
to have the matter hushed up by bribing one of the envoys with a large
sum of money and the hand of his sister, Gygsea. Macedonia took up the
position of a subject kingdom, and owned for her true lord the great
monarch of Western Asia.
</p>
<p>
Megabazus, having accomplished the task assigned him, proceeded to
Sardis, where Darius had remained almost, if not quite, a full year His
place was taken by Otanes, the son of Sisamnes, a different person from
the conspirator, who rounded off the Persian conquests in these parts
by reducing, probably in B.C. 505, the cities of Byzantium, Chalcedon,
Antandrus, and Lamponium, with the two adjacent islands of Letnnos and
Imbrus. The inhabitants of all were, it appears, taxable, either with
having failed to give contingents towards the Scythian expedition,
or with having molested it on its return&mdash;crimes these, which Otanes
thought it right to punish by their general enslavement.
</p>
<p>
Darius, meanwhile, had proceeded to the seat of government, which
appears at this time to have been Susa. He had perhaps already built
there the great palace, whose remains have been recently disinterred
by English enterprise; or he may have wished to superintend the work of
construction. Susa, which was certainly from henceforth the main Persian
capital, possessed advantages over almost any other site. Its climate
was softer than that of Ecbatana and Persepolis, less sultry than that
of Babylon. Its position was convenient for communicating both with
the East and with the West. Its people were plastic, and probably
more yielding and submissive than the Medes or the Persians. The king,
fatigued with his warlike exertions, was glad for a while to rest and
recruit himself at Susa, in the tranquil life of the Court. For some
years he appears to have conceived no new aggressive project; and he
might perhaps have forgotten his designs upon Greece altogether, had not
his memory been stirred by a signal and extraordinary provocation.
</p>
<p>
The immediate circumstances which led to the Ionian Revolt belong to
Greek rather than to Persian history, and have been so fully treated of
by the historians of the Hellenic race that a knowledge of them may be
assumed as already possessed by the reader. What is chiefly remarkable
about them is, that they are so purely private and personal. A chance
quarrel between Aristagoras of Miletus and the Persian Megabates,
pecuniary difficulties pressing on the former, and the natural desire
of Histiseus, father-in-law of Aristagoras, to revisit his native place,
were undoubtedly the direct and immediate causes of what became a
great national outbreak. That there must have been other and wider
predisposing causes can scarcely be doubted. Among them two may be
suggested. The presence of Darius in Asia Minor, and his friendliness
towards the tyrants who bore sway in most of the Greek cities, were
calculated to elate those persons in their own esteem, and to encourage
in them habits and acts injurious or offensive to their subjects. Their
tyranny under these circumstances would become more oppressive and
galling. At the same time the popular mind could not fail to associate
together the native despot and the foreign lord, who (it was clear to
all) supported and befriended each other. If the Greeks of Asia, like so
many of their brethren in Europe, had grown weary of their tyrants
and were desirous of rising against them, they would be compelled to
contemplate the chances of a successful resistance to the Persians.
And here there were circumstances in the recent history calculated
to inspirit them and give them hopes. Six hundred Greek ships, manned
probably by 120,000 men, had been lately brought together, and had
formed a united fleet. The fate of the Persian land-army had depended
on their fidelity. It is not surprising that a sense of strength should
have been developed, and something like a national spirit should have
grown up in such a condition of things.
</p>
<p>
If this were the state of feeling among the Greeks, the merit of
Aristagoras would be, that he perceived it, and, regardless of all class
prejudices, determined to take advantage of the chance which it gave
him of rising superior to his embarrassments. Throwing himself on the
popular feeling, the strength of which he had estimated aright, he by
the same act gave freedom to the cities, and plunged his nation into
a rebellion against Persia. It was easy for reason to show, when the
matter was calmly debated, that the probabilities of success against
the might of Darius were small. But the arrest of the tyrants by
Aristagoras, and his deliverance of them into the hands of their
subjects, was an appeal to passion against which reason was powerless.
No state could resist the temptation of getting rid of the tyranny under
which it groaned. But the expulsion of the vassal committed those who
took part in it to resist in arms the sovereign lord.
</p>
<p>
In the original revolt appear to have been included only the cities
of Ionia and AEolis. Aristagoras felt that some further strength was
needed, and determined to seek it in European Greece. Repulsed from
Sparta, which was disinclined to so distant an expedition, he applied
for aid to cities on which he had a special claim. Miletus counted
Athens as her mother state; and Eretria was indebted to her for
assistance in her great war with Chalcis. Applying in these quarters
Aristagoras succeeded better, but still obtained no very important help.
Athens voted him twenty ships, Eretria five and with the promise of
these succors he hastened back to Asia.
</p>
<p>
The European contingent soon afterwards arrived; and Aristagoras,
anxious to gain some signal success which should attract men to his
cause, determined on a most daring enterprise. This was no less than an
attack on Sardis, the chief seat of the Persian power in these parts,
and by far the most important city of Asia Minor. Sailing to Ephesus, he
marched up the valley of the Cayster, crossed Mount Tmolus, and took
the Lydian capital at the first onset. Artaphernes, the satrap, was only
able to save the citadel; the invaders began to plunder the town, and in
the confusion it caught fire and was burnt. Aristagoras and his troops
hastily retreated, but were overtaken before they could reach Ephesus by
the Persians quartered in the province, who fell upon them and gave
them a severe defeat. The expedition then broke up; the Asiatic Greeks
dispersed among their cities; the Athenians and Eretrians took ship and
sailed home.
</p>
<p>
Results followed that could scarcely have been anticipated. The failure
of the expedition was swallowed up in the glory of its one achievement.
It had taken Sardis&mdash;it had burnt one of the chief cities of the Great
King. The news spread like wildfire on every side, and was proclaimed
aloud in places where the defeat of Ephesus was never even whispered.
Everywhere revolt burst out. The Greeks of the Hellespont&mdash;not only
those of Asia but likewise those of Europe&mdash;the Carians and Caunians of
the south-western coast&mdash;even the distant Cyprians broke into rebellion;
the Scythians took heart and made a plundering raid through the Great
King's Thracian territories;4 vassal monarchs, like Miltiades, assumed
independence, and helped themselves to some of the fragments of the
Empire that seemed falling to pieces. If a great man, a Miltiades or
a Leondias, had been at the head of the movement, and if it had been
decently supported from the European side, a successful issue might
probably have been secured.
</p>
<p>
But Aristagoras was unequal to the occasion; and the struggle for
independence, which had promised so fair, was soon put down. Despite a
naval victory gained by the Greeks over the Phoenician fleet off Cyprus,
that island was recovered by the Persians within a year. Despite a
courage and a perseverance worthy of a better fate, the Carians were
soon afterwards forced to succumb. The reduction of the Hellespontine
Greeks and of the AEolians followed. The toils now closed around Ionia,
and her cities began to be attacked one by one; whereupon the incapable
Aristagoras, deserting the falling cause, betook himself to Europe,
where a just Nemesis pursued him: he died by a Thracian sword. After
this the climax soon arrived. Persia concentrated her strength upon
Miletus, the cradle of the revolt, and the acknowledged chief of the
cities; and though her sister states came gallantly to her aid, and a
fleet was collected which made it for a while doubtful which way victory
might incline, yet all was of no avail. Laziness and insubordination
began and treachery completed the work which all the force of Persia
might have failed to accomplish; the combined Ionian fleet was totally
defeated in the battle of Lade; and soon after Miletus herself fell.
The bulk of her inhabitants were transported into inner Asia and settled
upon the Persian Gulf. The whole Ionian coast was ravaged, and the
cities punished by the loss of their most beautiful maidens and youths.
The islands off the coast were swept of their inhabitants. The cities on
the Hellespont and Sea of Marmora were burnt. Miltiades barely escaped
from the Chersonese with the loss of his son and his kingdom. The flames
of rebellion were everywhere ruthlessly trampled out; and the power
of the Great King was once more firmly established over the coasts and
islands of the Propontis and the Egean Sea.
</p>
<p>
It remained, however, to take vengeance upon the foreigners who had
dared to lend their aid to the king's revolted subjects, and had borne
a part in the burning of Sardis. The pride of the Persians felt such
interference as an insult of the grossest kind: and the tale may well be
true that Darius, from the time that he first heard the news, employed
an officer to bid him daily "remember Athens." The schemes which he had
formerly entertained with respect to the reduction of Greece recurred
with fresh force to his mind; and the task of crushing the revolt was no
sooner completed than he proceeded to attempt their execution.
Selecting Mardonius, son of Gobryas the conspirator, and one of his
own sons-in-law, for general, he gave him the command of a powerful
expedition, which was to advance by way of Thrace, Macedonia, and
Thessaly, against Eretria and Athens. At the same time, with a wisdom
which we should scarcely have expected in an Oriental, he commissioned
him, ere he quitted Asia, to depose the tyrants who bore rule in the
Greek cities, and to allow the establishment of democracies in their
stead. Such a measure was excellently calculated to preserve the
fidelity of the Hellenic population and to prevent any renewal of
disturbance. It gave ample employment to unquiet spirits by opening to
them a career in their own states&mdash;and it removed the grievance which,
more than anything else, had produced the recent rebellion.
</p>
<p>
Mardonius having effected this change proceeded into Europe. He had a
large land force and a powerful navy, and at first was successful both
by land and sea. The fleet took Thasos, an island valuable for its
mines; and the army forced the Macedonians to exchange their position
of semi-independence for that of full Persian subjects, liable to both
tribute and military service. But this fair dawn was soon overcast. As
the fleet was rounding Athos a terrible tempest arose which, destroyed
300 triremes and more than 20,000 men, some of whom were devoured by
sea-monsters, while the remainder perished by drowning. On shore,
a night attack of the Brygi, a Thracian tribe dwelling in the tract
between the Strymon and the Axius, brought disaster upon the land force,
numbers of which were slain, while Mardonius himself received a wound.
This disgrace, indeed, was retrieved by subsequent operations, which
forced the Brygi to make their submission; but the expedition found
itself in no condition to advance further, and Mardonius retreated into
Asia.
</p>
<p>
Darius, however, did not allow failure to turn him from his purpose.
The attack of Mardonius was followed within two years by the well-known
expedition under Datis (B.C. 490), which, avoiding the dangers of Athos,
sailed direct to its object, crossing the Egean by the line of the
Cyclades, and falling upon Eretria and Attica. Eretria's punishment
warned the Athenians to resist to the uttermost; and the skill of
Miltiades, backed by the valor of his countrymen, gave to Athens the
great victory of Marathon. Datis fell back upon Asia, having suffered
worse disasters than his predecessor, and bore to the king the
melancholy tidings that his vast force of from 100,000 to 200,000 men
had been met and worsted by 20,000 Athenians and Plataeans.
</p>
<p>
Still Darius was not shaken in his resolution. He only issued fresh
orders for the collection of men, ships, and materials. For three years
Asia resounded with the din of preparation; and it is probable that in
the fourth year a fresh expedition would have been led into Greece, had
not an important occurrence prevented it. Egypt, always discontented
with its subject position under a race which despised its religion, and
perhaps occasionally persecuted it, broke out into open revolt (B.C.
487). Darius, it seems, determined to divide his forces, and proceed
simultaneously against both enemies; he even contemplated leading one
of the two expeditions in person; but before his preparations were
completed his vital powers failed. He died in the year following the
Egyptian revolt (B.C. 486), in the sixty-third year of his age, and
the thirty-sixth of his reign, leaving his crown to his eldest son by
Atossa, Xerxes.
</p>
<p>
The character of Darius will have revealed itself with tolerable
clearness in the sketch which has been here given of the chief events
of his reign. But a brief summary of some of its main points may not be
superfluous. Darius Hystaspis was, next to Cyrus, the greatest of the
Persian kings; and he was even superior to Cyrus in some particulars.
His military talent has been underrated. Though not equal to the founder
of the Empire in this respect, he deserves the credit of energy, vigor,
foresight, and judicious management in his military expeditions, of
promptness in resolving and ability in executing, of discrimination in
the selection of generals, and of a power of combination not often found
in Oriental commanders. He was personally brave, and quite willing to
expose himself, even in his old age, to dangers and hardships. But
he did not unnecessarily thrust himself into peril. He was content to
employ generals, where the task to be accomplished did not seem to be
beyond their powers; and he appears to have been quite free from an
unworthy jealousy of their successes. He was a man of kindly and warm
feeling&mdash;strongly attached to his friends; he was clement and even
generous towards conquered foes. When he thought the occasion required
it, he could be severe but his inclination was towards mildness and
indulgence. He excelled all the other Persian kings in the arts of
peace. To him, and him alone, the Empire owed its organization. He was
a skilful administrator, a good financier, and a wise and far-seeing
ruler. Of all the Persian princes he is the only one who can be called
"many-sided." He was organizer, general, statesman, administrator,
builder, patron of arts and literature, all in one. Without him Persia
would probably have sunk as rapidly as she rose, and would be known to
us only as one of the many meteor powers which have shot athwart the
horizon of the East.
</p>
<p>
Xerxes, the eldest son of Darius by Atossa, succeeded his father by
virtue of a formal act of choice. It was a Persian custom that the king,
before he went out of his dominions on an expedition, should nominate a
successor. Darius must have done this before his campaign in Thrace
and Scythia; and if Xerxes was then, as is probable, a mere boy, it is
impossible that he should have received the appointment. Artobazanes,
the eldest of all Darius's sons, whose mother, a daughter of Gobryas,
was married to Darius before he became king, was most likely then
nominated, and was thenceforth regarded as the heir-apparent. When,
however, towards the close of his reign Darius again proposed to head
a foreign expedition, an opportunity occurred of disturbing this
arrangement, of which Atossa, Darius's favorite wife, whose influence
over her husband was unbounded, determined to take advantage. According
to the law, a fresh signification of the sovereign's will was now
requisite; and Atossa persuaded Darius to make it in favor of Xerxes.
The pleas put forward were, first, that he was the eldest son of the
king, and secondly, that he was descended from Cyrus. This latter
argument could not fail to have weight. Backed by the influence of
Atossa, it prevailed over all other considerations; and hence Xerxes
obtained the throne.
</p>
<p>
If we may trust the informants of Herodotus, it was the wish of Xerxes
on his accession to discontinue the preparations against Greece, and
confine his efforts to the re-conquest of Egypt. Though not devoid of
ambition, he may well have been distrustful of his own powers; and,
having been nurtured in luxury, he may have shrunk from the perils of a
campaign in unknown regions. But he was surrounded by advisers who had
interests opposed to his inclinations, and who worked on his facile
temper till they prevailed on him to take that course which seemed best
calculated to promote their designs. Mardonius was anxious to retrieve
his former failure, and expected, if Greece were conquered, that the
rich prize would become his own satrapy. The refugee princes of the
family of Pisistratus hoped to be reinstated under Persian influence as
dependent despots of Athens. Demaratus of Sparta probably cherished
a similar expectation with regard to that capital. The Persian nobles
generally, who profited by the spoils of war, and who were still full of
the military spirit, looked forward with pleasure to an expedition
from which they anticipated victory, plunder, and thousands of valuable
captives. The youthful king was soon persuaded that the example of his
predecessors required him to undertake some fresh conquest, while the
honor of Persia absolutely demanded that the wrongs inflicted upon her
by Athens should be avenged. Before, however, turning his arms against
Greece, two revolts required his attention. In the year B.C. 485&mdash;the
second of his reign&mdash;he marched into Egypt, which he rapidly reduced to
obedience and punished by increasing its burthens. Soon afterwards he
seems to have provoked a rebellion of the Babylonians by acts which they
regarded as impious, and avenged by killing their satrap, Zopyrus, and
proclaiming their independence. Megabyzus, the son of Zopyrus, recovered
the city, which was punished by the plunder and ruin of its famous
temple and the desolation of many of its shrines.
</p>
<p>
Xerxes was now free to bend all his efforts against Greece, and,
appreciating apparently to the full the magnitude and difficulty of the
task, resolved that nothing should be left undone which could possibly
be done in order to render success certain. The experience of former
years had taught some important lessons. The failure of Datis had proved
that such an expedition as could be conveyed by sea across the Egean
would be insufficient to secure the object sought, and that the only
safe road for a conqueror whose land force constituted his real strength
was along the shores of the European continent. But if a large army
took this long and circuitous route, it must be supported by a powerful
fleet; and this involved a new danger. The losses of Mardonius off Athos
had shown the perils of Egean navigation, and taught the lesson that the
naval force must be at first far more than proportionate to the needs
of the army, in order that it might still be sufficient notwithstanding
some considerable disasters. At the same time they had indicated one
special place of danger, which might be avoided, if proper measures
were taken. Xerxes, in the four years which followed on the reduction of
Egypt, continued incessantly to make the most gigantic preparations
for his intended attack upon Greece, and among them included all the
precautions which a wise foresight could devise in order to ward off
every conceivable peril. A general order was issued to all the satraps
throughout the Empire, calling on them to levy the utmost force of their
province for the new war; while, as the equipment of Oriental troops
depends greatly on the purchase and distribution of arms by their
commander, a rich reward was promised to the satrap whose contingent
should appear at the appointed place and time in the most gallant array.
Orders for ships and transports of different kinds were given to the
maritime states, with such effect that above 1200 triremes and 3000
vessels of an inferior description were collected together. Magazines
of corn were formed at various points along the intended line of route.
Above all, it was determined to bridge the Hellespont by a firm and
compact structure, which it was thought would secure the communication
of the army from interruption by the elements; and at the same time it
was resolved to cut through the isthmus which joined Mount Athos to the
continent, in order to preserve the fleet from disaster at that most
perilous part of the proposed voyage. These remarkable works, which made
a deep impression on the minds of the Greeks, have been ascribed to
a mere spirit of ostentation on the part of Xerxes; the vain-glorious
monarch wished, it is supposed, to parade his power, and made a useless
bridge and an absurd cutting merely for the purpose of exhibiting to
the world the grandeur of his ideas and the extent of his resources. But
there is no necessity for travelling beyond the line of ordinary human
motive in order to discover a reason for the works in question. The
bridge across the Hellespont was a mere repetition of the construction
by which Darius had passed into Europe when he made his Scythian
expedition, and probably seemed to a Persian not a specially dignified
or very wonderful way of crossing so narrow a strait, but merely the
natural mode of passage. The only respect in which the bridge of Xerxes
differed from constructions with which the Persians were thoroughly
familiar, was in its superior solidity and strength. The shore-cables
were of unusual size and weight, and apparently of unusual materials;
the formation of a double line&mdash;of two bridges, in fact, instead of
one&mdash;was almost without a parallel; and the completion of the work by
laying on the ordinary plank-bridge a solid causeway composed of earth
and brushwood, with a high bulwark on either side, was probably, if not
unprecedented, at any rate very uncommon. Boat-bridges were usually,
as they are even now in the East, somewhat rickety constructions, which
animals unaccustomed to them could with difficulty be induced to cross.
The bridge of Xerxes was a high-road, as AEschylus calls it along, which
men, horses, and vehicles might pass with as much comfort and facility
as they could move on shore.
</p>
<p>
The utility of such a work is evident. Without it Xerxes must have been
reduced to the necessity of embarking in ships, conveying across the
strait, and disembarking, not only his entire host, but all its stores,
tents, baggage, horses, camels, and sumpter-beasts. If the numbers of
his army approached even the lowest estimate that has been formed of
them, it is not too much to say that many weeks must have been spent in
this operation. As it was, the whole expedition marched across in seven
days. In the case of ship conveyance, continual accidents would have
happened: the transport would from time to time have been interrupted by
bad weather; and great catastrophes might have occurred. By means of the
bridge the passage was probably effected without any loss of either man
or beast. Moreover, the bridge once established, there was a safe
line of communication thenceforth between the army in Europe and the
headquarters of the Persian power in Asia, along which might pass
couriers, supplies, and reinforcements, if they should be needed.
Further, the grandeur, massiveness, and apparent stability of the work
was calculated to impose upon the minds of men, and to diminish their
power of resistance by impressing them strongly with a sense of the
irresistible greatness and strength of the invader.
</p>
<p>
The canal of Athos was also quite a legitimate and judicious
undertaking. <a href="#image-0002">[PLATE LXI.]</a> No portion of the Greek coast is so dangerous
as that about Athos. Greek boatmen even at the present day refuse to
attempt the circumnavigation; and probably any government less apathetic
than that of the Turks would at once re-open the old cutting. The work
was one of very little difficulty, the breadth of the isthmus being less
than a mile and a half, the material sand and marl, and the greatest
height of the natural ground above the level of the sea about fifty
feet. The construction of a canal in such a locality was certainly
better than the formation of a ship-groove or Diolcus&mdash;the substitute
for it proposed by Ferodotus, <a href="#image-0002">[PLATE LXI.]</a> not to mention that it is
doubtful whether at the time that this cutting was made ship-grooves
were known even to the Greeks.

Xerxes, having brought his preparations into a state of forwardness,
having completed his canal and his bridge&mdash;after one failure with the
latter, for which the constructors and the sea were punished&mdash;proceeded,
in the year B.C. 481, along the "Royal Road" from Susa to Sardis, and
wintered at the Lydian capital. His army is said to have accompanied
him; but more probably it joined him in the spring, flocking in,
contingent after contingent, from the various provinces of his vast
Empire. Forty-nine nations, according to Herodotus, served under his
standard; and their contingents made up a grand total of eighteen
hundred thousand men. Of these, eighty thousand were cavalry, while
twenty thousand rode in chariots or on camels; the remainder served on
foot. There are no sufficient means of testing these numbers. Figures
in the mouth of an Oriental are vague and almost unmeaning; armies are
never really counted: there is no such thing as a fixed and definite
"strength" of a division or a battalion. Herodotus tells us that a rough
attempt at numbering the infantry of the host was made on this occasion;
but it was of so rude and primitive a description that little dependence
can be placed on the results obtained by it. Ten thousand men were
counted, and were made to stand close together; a line was then drawn
round them, and a wall built on the line to the height of a man's waist;
within the enclosure thus made all the troops in turn entered, and each
time that the enclosure appeared to be full, ten thousand were supposed
to be within it. Estimated in this way, the infantry was regarded as
amounting to 1,700,000. It is clear that such mode of counting was of
the roughest kind, and might lead to gross exaggeration. Each commander
would wish his troops to be thought more numerous than they really were,
and would cause the enclosure to appear full when several thousands
more might still have found room within it. Nevertheless there would be
limits beyond which exaggeration could not go; and if Xerxes was made to
believe that the land force which he took with him into Europe amounted
to nearly two millions of men, it is scarcely doubtful but that it must
have exceeded one million.
</p>
<p>
The motley composition of such a host has been described in a former
chapter. Each nation was armed and equipped after its own fashion, and
served in a body, often under a distinct commander. The army marched
through Asia in a single column, which was not, however, continuous,
but was broken into three portions. The first portion consisted of the
baggage animals and about half of the contingents of the nations; the
second was composed wholly of native Persians, who preceded and followed
the emblems of religion and the king; the third was made up of the
remaining national contingents. The king himself rode alternately in
a chariot and in a litter. He was preceded immediately by ten sacred
horses, and a sacred chariot drawn by eight milk-white steeds. Round
him and about him were the choicest troops of the whole army, twelve
thousand horse and the same number of foot, all Persians, and those too
not taken at random, but selected carefully from the whole mass of the
native soldiery. Among them seem to have been the famous "Immortals"&mdash;a
picked body of 10,000 footmen, always maintained at exactly the same
number, and thence deriving their appellation.
</p>
<p>
The line of march from Sardis to Abydos was only partially along the
shore. The army probably descended the valley of the Hermus nearly to
its mouth, and then struck northward into the Caicus vale, crossing
which it held on its way, with Mount Kara-dagh (Cane) on the left,
across the Atarnean plain, and along the coast to Adramytium (Adramyti)
and Antandros, whence it again struck inland, and, crossing the ridge
of Ida, descended into the valley of the Scamander. Some losses were
incurred from the effects of a violent thunderstorm amid the mountains;
but they cannot have been of a any great consequence. On reaching the
Scamander the army found its first difficulty with respect to water.
That stream was probably low, and the vast host of men and animals
were unable to obtain from it a supply sufficient for their wants. This
phenomenon, we are told, frequently recurred afterwards; it surprises
the English reader, but is not really astonishing, since, in hot
countries, even considerable streams are often reduced to mere threads
of water during the summer.
</p>
<p>
Rounding the hills which skirt the Scamander valley upon the east, the
army marched past Rhoeteum, Ophrynium, and Dardanus to Abydos. Here
Xerxes, seated upon a marble throne, which the people of Abydos had
erected for him on the summit of a hill, was able to see at one glance
his whole, armament, and to feast his eyes with the sight. It is not
likely that any misgivings occurred to him at such a moment. Before him
lay his vast host, covering with its dense masses the entire low ground
between the hills and the sea; beyond was the strait, and to his left
the open sea, white with the sails of four thousand ships; the green
fields of the Chersonese smiled invitingly a little further on; while,
between him and the opposite shore, the long lines of his bridges lay
darkling upon the sea, like a yoke placed upon the neck of a captive.
Having seen all, the king gave his special attention to the fleet, which
he now perhaps beheld in all its magnitude for the first time. Desirous
of knowing which of his subjects were the best sailors, he gave orders
for a sailing-match, which were at once carried out. The palm was borne
off by the Phoenicians of Sidon, who must have beaten not only their own
countrymen of Tyre, but the Greeks of Asia and the islands.
</p>
<p>
On the next day the passage took place. It was accompanied by religious
ceremonies. Waiting for the sacred hour of sunrise, the leader of the
host, as the first rays appeared, poured a libation from a golden goblet
into the sea, and prayed to Mithra that he might effect the conquest of
Europe. As he prayed he cast into the sea the golden goblet, and with it
a golden bowl and a short Persian sword. Meanwhile the multitude strewed
all the bridge with myrtle boughs, and perfumed it with clouds of
incense. The "Immortals" crossed first, wearing garlands on their
heads. The king, with the sacred chariot and horses passed over on the
second day. For seven days and seven nights the human stream flowed
on without intermission across one bridge, while the attendants and the
baggage-train made use of the other. The lash was employed to quicken
the movements of laggards. At last the whole army was in Europe, and the
march resumed its regularity.
</p>
<p>
It is unnecessary to follow in detail the advance of the host along the
coast of Thrace, across Chalcidice, and round the Thermaic Gulf into
Pieria. If we except the counting of the fleet and army at Doriscus no
circumstances of much interest diversified this portion of the march,
which lay entirely through territories that had previously submitted
to the Great King. The army spread itself over a wide tract of country,
marching generally in three divisions, which proceeded by three parallel
lines&mdash;one along the coast, another at some considerable distance
inland, and a third, with which was Xerxes himself, midway between them.
At every place where Xerxes stopped along his line of route the natives
had, besides furnishing corn for his army, to entertain him and his
suite at a great banquet, the cost of which was felt as a heavy burthen.
Contributions of troops or ships were also required from all the cities
and tribes; and thus both fleet and army continually swelled as they
advanced onward. In crossing the track between the Strymon and the Axius
some damage was suffered by the baggage-train from lions, which came
down from the mountains during the night and devoured many of the
camels; but otherwise the march was effected without loss, and the fleet
and army reached the borders of Thessaly intact, and in good condition.
Here it was found that there was work for the pioneers, and a
reconnaissance of the enemy's country before entering it was probably
also thought desirable. The army accordingly halted some days in Pieria,
while preparations were being made for crossing the Olympic range into
the Thessalian lowland.
</p>
<p>
During the halt intelligence arrived which seemed to promise the invader
an easy conquest. Xerxes, while he was staying at Sardis, had sent
heralds to all the Grecian states, excepting Athens and Sparta, with a
demand for earth and water, the recognized symbols of submission. His
envoys now returned, and brought him favorable replies from at least
one-third of the continental Greeks&mdash;from the Perrhaebians, Thessalians,
Dolopians, Magnetians, Achaeans of Phthiotis, Enianians, Malians,
Locrians, and from most of the Boeotians. Unless it were the
insignificant Phocis, no hostile country seemed to intervene between the
place where his army lay and the great object of the expedition, Attica.
Xerxes, therefore, having first viewed the pass of Tempe, and seen with
his own eyes that no enemy lay encamped beyond, passed over the Olympic
range by a road cut through the woods by his army, and proceeded
southwards across Thessaly and Achaea Phthiotis into Malis, the fertile
plain at the mouth of the Spercheius river. Here, having heard that a
Greek force was in the neighborhood, he pitched his camp not far from
the small town of Trachis.
</p>
<p>
Thus far had the Greeks allowed the invader to penetrate their country
without offering him any resistance. Originally there had been an
intention of defending Thessaly, and an army under Evsenetus, a Spartan
polemarch, and Themistocles, the great Athenian, had proceeded to Tempe,
in order to cooperate with the Thessalians in guarding the pass. But the
discovery that the Olympic range could be crossed in the,place where
the army of Xerxes afterwards passed it had shown that the position was
untenable; and it had been then resolved that the stand should be
made at the next defensible position, Thermopylae. <a href="#image-0003">[PLATE LXII.]</a> Here,
accordingly, a force was found&mdash;small, indeed, if it be compared with
the number of the assailants, but sufficient to defend such a position
as that where it was posted against the world in arms. Three hundred
Spartans, with their usual retinue of helots, 700 Lacedaemonians, other
Peloponnesians to the number of 2800, 1000 Phocians, the same number
of Locrians, 700 Thespians, and 400 Thebans, formed an army of 9000
men&mdash;quite as numerous a force as could be employed with any effect in
the defile they were sent to guard. The defile was a long and narrow
pass shut in between a high mountain, Callidromus, and the sea, and
crossed at one point by a line of wall in which was a single gateway.
Unless the command of the sea were gained, or another mode of crossing
the mountains discovered, the pass could scarcely be forced.

<p>
Xerxes, however, confident in his numbers&mdash;after waiting four days at
Trachis, probably in the hope that his fleet would join him&mdash;proceeded
on the fifth day to the assault. First the Medes and Cissians, then
the famous "Immortals" were sent into the jaws of the pass against the
immovable foe; but neither detachment could make any impression. The
long spears, large shields, and heavy armor of the Greeks, their skilful
tactics, and steady array, were far more than a match for the inferior
equipments and discipline of the Asiatics. Though the attack was made
with great gallantry, both on this day and the next, it failed to
produce the slightest effect. Very few of the Greeks were either slain
or wounded; and it seemed as if the further advance of a million of men
was to be stopped by a force less than a hundredth part of their number.
</p>
<p>
But now information reached Xerxes which completely changed the face
of affairs. There was a rough mountain-path leading from Trachis up
the gorge of the Asopus and across Callidromus to the rear of the Greek
position, which had been unknown to the Greeks when they decided on
making their first stand at Thermopylae, and which they only discovered
when their plans no longer admitted of alteration. It was, perhaps,
not much more than a goat-track, and apparently they had regarded it as
scarcely practicable, since they had thought its defence might be safely
entrusted to a thousand Phocians. Xerxes, however, on learning the
existence of the track, resolved at once to make trial of it. His
Persian soldiers were excellent mountaineers. He ordered Hydarnes to
take the "Immortals," and, guided by a native, to proceed along the path
by night, and descend with early dawn into the rear of the Greeks, who
would then be placed between two fires. The operation was performed with
complete success. The Phocian guard, surprised at the summit, left the
path free while they sought a place of safety. The Greeks in the pass
below, warned during the night of their danger, in part fled, in part
resolved on death. When morning came, Leonidas, at the head of about
half his original army, moved forward towards the Malian plain, and
there met the advancing Persians. A bloody combat ensued, in which the
Persians lost by far the greater number; but the ranks of the Greeks
were gradually thinned, and they were beaten back step by step into the
narrowest part of the pass, where finally they all perished, except the
four hundred Thebans, who submitted and were made prisoners.
</p>
<p>
So terminated the first struggle on the soil of Greece, between the
invaders and the invaded. It seemed to promise that, though at vast
cost, Persia would be victorious. If her loss in the three days' combat
was 20,000 men, as Herodotus states, yet, as that of her enemy was 4000,
the proportionate advantage was on her side.
</p>
<p>
But, for the conquest of such a country as Greece, it was requisite, not
only that the invader should succeed on land, but also that he should be
superior at sea. Xerxes had felt this, and had brought with him a fleet,
calculated, as he imagined, to sweep the Greek navy from the Egean. As
far as the Pagasaean Gulf, opposite the northern extremity of Euboea,
his fleet had advanced without meeting an enemy. It had encountered one
terrible storm off the coast of Magnesia, and had lost 400 vessels; but
this loss was scarcely felt in so vast an armament. When from Aphetse,
at the mouth of the gulf, the small Greek fleet, amounting to no more
than 271 vessels, was seen at anchor off Artemisium, the only fear which
the Persian commanders entertained was lest it should escape them. They
at once detached 200 vessels to sail round the Coast coast of Euboea,
and cut off the possibility of retreat. When, however, these vessels
were all lost in a storm, and when in three engagements on three
successive days, the Greek fleet showed itself fully able to contend
against the superior numbers of its antagonist, the Persians themselves
could not fail to see that their naval supremacy was more than doubtful.
The fleet at Artemisium was not the entire Greek naval force; on another
occasion it might be augumented, while their own could scarcely expect
to receive reinforcements. The fights at Artemisium foreshadowed a day
when the rival fleets would no longer meet and part on equal terms, but
Persia would have to acknowledge herself inferior.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, however, the balance of advantage rested with the invaders.
The key of Northern Greece was won, and Phocis, Locris, Boeotia, Attica,
and the Megarid lay open to the Persian army. The Greek fleet could gain
nothing by any longer maintaining the position of Artemisium, and fell
back towards the south, while its leaders anxiously considered where it
should next take up its station. The Persians pressed on both by land
and sea. A rapid march through Phocis and Boeotia brought Xerxes to
Athens, soon after the Athenians, knowing that resistance would be vain,
had evacuated it. The Acropolis, defended by a few fanatics, was taken
and burnt. One object of the expedition was thus accomplished. Athens
lay in ruins; and the whole of Attica was occupied by the conqueror.
The Persian fleet, too, finding the channel of the Euripus clear, sailed
down it, and rounding Sunium, came to anchor in the bay of Phalerum.
</p>
<p>
In the councils of the Greeks all was doubt and irresolution. The
army, which ought to have mustered in full force at Thermopylae and
Callidromus, and which, after those passes were forced, might have
defended Cithseron and Parnes, had never ventured beyond the Isthmus
of Corinth, and was there engaged in building a wall across the neck of
land from sea to sea. The fleet lay off Salamis, where it was detained
by the entreaties of the Athenians, who had placed in that island the
greater part of the non-combatant population; but the inclination was
strong on the part of many to withdraw westward and fight the next
battle, if a battle must be fought, in the vicinity of the land force,
which would be a protection in case of defeat. Could Xerxes have had
patience for a few days, the combined fleet would have broken up. The
Peloponnesian contingents would have withdrawn to the isthmus; and the
Athenians, despairing of success, would probably have sailed away to
Italy. But the Great King, when he saw the vast disproportion
between his own fleet and that of the enemy, could not believe in the
possibility of the Greeks offering a successful resistance. Like a
modern emperor, who imagined that, if only he could have been with his
fleet, all would necessarily have gone well, Xerxes supposed that by
having the sea-fight under his own eye he would be sure of victory. Thus
again, as at Artemisium, the only fear felt was lest the Greeks should
fly, and in that way escape chastisement. Orders were therefore issued
to the Persian fleet to close up at once, and blockade the eastern end
of the Salaminian strait, while a detachment repeated the attempted
manoeuvre at Euboea, and sailed round the island to guard the channel at
its western outlet.
</p>
<p>
These movements were executed late in the day on which the Persian
fleet arrived at Phalerum. During the night intelligence reached the
commanders that the retreat of the Greeks was about to commence at once;
whereupon the Persian right wing was pushed forward into the strait,
and carried beyond the Greek position so as to fill the channel where
it opens into the bay of Eleusis. The remainder of the night passed
in preparations for the battle on both sides. At daybreak both fleets
advanced from their respective shores, the Persians being rather the
assailants. Their thousand vessels were drawn up in three lines, and
charged their antagonists with such spirit that the general inclination
on the part of the Greeks was at first to retreat. Some of their ships
had almost touched the shore, when the bold example of one of the
captains, or a cry of reproach from unknown lips, produced a revulsion
of feeling, and the whole line advanced in good order. The battle was
for a short time doubtful; but soon the superiority of Greek naval
tactics began to tell. The Persian vessels became entangled one with
another, and crashing together broke each other's oars. The triple
line increased their difficulties. If a vessel, overmatched, sought to
retreat, it necessarily came into collision with the ships stationed
in its rear. These moreover pressed too eagerly forward, since their
captains were anxious to distinguish themselves in order to merit the
approval of Xerxes. The Greeks found themselves able to practice
with good effect their favorite manoeuvre of the <i>periplus</i>, and thus
increased the confusion. It was not long before the greater part of
the Persian fleet became a mere helpless mass of shattered or damaged
vessels. Five hundred are said to have been sunk&mdash;the majority by the
enemy, but some even by their own friends. The sea was covered with
wrecks, and with wretches who clung to them, till the ruthless enemy
slew them or forced them to let go their hold.
</p>
<p>
This defeat was a death-blow to the hopes of Xerxes, and sealed the fate
of the expedition. From the moment that he realized to himself the fact
of the entire inability of his fleet to cope with that of the Greeks,
Xerxes made up his mind to return with all haste to Asia. From
over-confidence he fell into the opposite extreme of despair, and made
no effort to retrieve his ill fortune. His fleet was ordered to sail
straight for the Hellespont, and to guard the bridges until he reached
them with his army. He himself retreated hastily along the same road
by which he had advanced, his whole army accompanying him as far as
Thessaly, where Marnonius was left with 260,000 picked men, to prevent
pursuit, and to renew the attempt against Greece in the ensuing year.
Xerxes pressed on to the Hellespont, losing vast numbers of his troops
by famine and sickness on the way, and finally returned into Asia, not
by his magnificent bridge, which a storm had destroyed, but on board a
vessel, which, according to some, narrowly escaped shipwreck during the
passage. Even in Asia disaster pursued him. Between Abydos and Sardis
his army suffered almost as much from over-indulgence as it had
previously suffered from want; and of the mighty host which had gone
forth from the Lydian capital in the spring not very many thousands can
have re-entered it in the autumn.
</p>
<p>
Still, however, there was a possibility that the success which his
own arms had failed to achieve might reward the exertions of his
lieutenants. Mardonius had expressed himself confident that with 300,000
picked soldiers he could overpower all resistance, and make Greece
a satrapy of Persia. Xerxes had raised his forces to that amount by
sending Artabazus back from Sestos at the head of a <i>corps d'armee</i>
numbering 40,000 men. The whole army of 300,000 wintered in Thessaly;
and Mardonius, when spring came, having vainly endeavored to detach the
Athenians from the Grecian ranks, marched through Boeotia in Attica, and
occupied Athens for the second time. Hence he proceeded to menace the
Peloponnese, where he formed an alliance with the Argives, who promised
him that they would openly embrace the Persian cause. At the same time
the Athenians, finding that Sparta took no steps to help them, began to
waver in their resistance, and to contemplate accepting the terms which
Mardonius was still willing to grant them. The fate of Greece trembled
in the balance, and apparently was determined by the accident of a death
and a succession, rather than by any wide-spread patriotic feeling or
any settled course of policy. Cleombrotus, regent for the young son
of Leonidas, died, and his brother Pausanias&mdash;a brave, clever, and
ambitious man&mdash;took his place. We can scarcely be wrong in ascribing&mdash;at
least in part&mdash;to this circumstance the unlooked-for change of policy,
which electrified the despondent ambassadors of Athens almost as soon as
Pausanias was installed in power. It was suddenly announced that
Sparta would take the offensive. Ten thousand hoplites and 400,000
light-armed&mdash;the largest army that she ever levied&mdash;took the field,
and, joined at the isthmus by above 25,000 Peloponnesians, and soon
afterwards by almost as many Athenians and Megarians, proceeded to seek
the foreigners, first in Attica, and then in the position to which they
had retired in Boeotia. On the skirts of Citheeron, near Platsea, a
hundred and eight thousand Greeks confronted more than thrice their
number of Persians and Persian subjects; and now at length the trial
was to be made whether, in fair and open fight on land, Greece or Persia
would be superior. A suspicion of what the result would be might have
been derived from Marathon. But there the Persians had been taken at a
disadvantage, when the cavalry, their most important arm, was absent.
Here the error of Datis was not likely to be repeated. Mardonius had a
numerous and well-armed cavalry, which he handled with no little skill.
It remained to be seen, when the general engagement came, whether, with
both arms brought fully into play, the vanquished at Marathon would be
the victors.
</p>
<p>
The battle of Plataea was brought on under circumstances very
unfavorable to the Greeks. Want of water and a difficulty about
provisions had necessitated a night movement on their part. The
cowardice of all the small contingents, and the obstinacy of an
individual Spartan, disconcerted the whole plan of the operation, and
left the Lacedaemonians and the Athenians at daybreak separated from
each other, and deserted by the whole body of their allies. Mardonius
attacked at once, and prevented the junction of the two allies, so that
two distinct and separate engagements went on at the same time. In both
the Greeks were victorious. The Spartans repulsed the Persian horse and
foot, slew Mardonius and were the first to assail the Persian camp. The
Athenians defeated the <i>medizing</i> Greeks, and effected a breach in
the defences of the camp, on which the Spartans had failed to make any
impression. A terrible carnage followed. The contingent of 40,000 troops
under Artabazus alone drew off in good order.
</p>
<p>
The remainder were seized with panic, and were either slaughtered like
sheep or fled in complete disarray. Seventy thousand Greeks not only
defeated but destroyed the army of 300,000 barbarians, which melted
away and disappeared making no further stand anywhere. The disaster of
Marathon was repeated on a larger scale, and without the resource of
an embarkation. Henceforth the immense superiority of Greek troops to
Persian was well known on both sides; and nothing but the distance from
Greece of her vital parts, and the quarrels of the Greek states among
themselves, preserved for nearly a century and a half the doomed empire
of Persia.
</p>
<p>
The immediate result of the defeats of Salamis and Platsea was a
contraction of the Persian boundary towards the west. Though a few
Persian garrisons maintained themselves for some years on the further
side of the straits, soothing thereby the wounded vanity of the Great
King, who liked to think that he had still a hold on Europe; yet there
can be no doubt that, after the double flight of Xerxes and Artabazus,
Macedonia, Pseonia, and Thrace recovered their independence. Persia lost
her European provinces, and began the struggle to retain those of Asia.
Terminus receded, and having once receded never advanced again in this
quarter. The Greeks took the offensive. Sailing to Asia, they not only
liberated from their Persian bondage the islands which lay along the
coast, but landing their men on the continent, attacked and defeated
an army of 60,000 Persians at Mycale, and destroyed the remnant of the
ships that had escaped from Salamis. Could they have made up their minds
to maintain a powerful fleet permanently on the coast of Asia, they
might at once have deprived Persia of her whole sea-hoard on the
Propontis and the Egean; but neither of the two great powers of Greece
was prepared for such a resolve. Sparta disliked distant expeditions;
and Athens did not as yet see her way to undertaking the protection
of the continental Greeks. She had much to do at home, and had not
yet discovered those weak points in her adversary's harness, which
subsequently enabled her to secure by treaty the freedom of the Greek
cities upon the mainland. For the present, therefore, Persia only lost
the bulk of her European possessions, and the islands of the Propontis
and the Egean.
</p>
<p>
The circumstances which caused a renewal of Greek agressions upon Asia
towards the close of the reign of Xerxes are not very clearly narrated
by the authors who speak of them. It appears, however, that after twelve
years of petty operations, during which Eion was recovered, and Doriscus
frequently attacked, but without effect, the Athenians resolved, in B.C.
466, upon a great expedition to the eastward. Collecting a fleet of
300 vessels, which was placed under the command of Cimon, the son of
Miltiades, they sailed to the coast of Caria and Lycia, where they drove
the Persian garrisons out of the Greek towns, and augmenting their
navy by fresh contingents at every step, proceeded along the shores of
Pamphylia as far as the mouth of the river Eurymedon, where they found
a Phoenician fleet of 340 vessels, and a Persian army, stationed to
protect the territory. Engaging first the fleet they defeated it, and
drove it ashore, after which they disembarked and gained a victory
over the Persian army. As many as two hundred triremes were taken
or destroyed. They then sailed on towards Cyprus, where they met and
destroyed a squadron of eighty ships, which was on its way to reinforce
the fleet at the Eurymedon. Above a hundred vessels, 20,000 captives,
and a vast amount of plunder were the prize of this war; which had,
however, no further effect on the relations of the two powers.
</p>
<p>
In the following year the reign of Xerxes came to an end abruptly.
With this monarch seems to have begun those internal disorders of the
seraglio, which made the Court during more than a hundred and forty
years a perpetual scene of intrigues, assassinations, executions, and
conspiracies. Xerxes, who appears to have only one wife, Amestris,
the daughter (or grand-daughter) of the conspirator, Otanes, permitted
himself the free indulgence of illicit passion among the princesses
of the Court, the wives of his own near relatives. The most horrible
results followed. Amestris vented her jealous spite on those whom she
regarded as guilty of stealing from her the affections of her husband;
and to prevent her barbarities from producing rebellion, it was
necessary to execute the persons whom she had provoked, albeit they were
near relations of the monarch. The taint of incontinence spread among
the members of the royal family; and a daughter of the king, who was
married to one of the most powerful nobles, became notorious for
her excesses. Eunuchs rose into power, and fomented the evils which
prevailed. The king made himself bitter enemies among those whose
position was close to his person. At last, Artabanus, chief of the
guard, a courtier of high rank, and Aspamitres, a eunuch, who held the
office of chamberlain, conspired against their master, and murdered him
in his sleeping apartment, after he had reigned twenty years.
</p>
<p>
The character of Xerxes falls below that of any preceding monarch.
Excepting that he was not wholly devoid of a certain magnanimity, which
made him listen patiently to those who opposed his views or gave him
unpalatable advice and which prevented him from exacting vengeance on
some occasions, he had scarcely a trait whereon the mind can rest with
any satisfaction. Weak and easily led, puerile in his gusts of passion
and his complete abandonment of himself to them&mdash;selfish, fickle,
boastful, cruel, superstitious, licentious&mdash;he exhibits to us the
Oriental despot in the most contemptible of all his aspects&mdash;that
wherein the moral and the intellectual qualities are equally in defect,
and the career is one unvarying course of vice and folly. From Xerxes we
have to date at once the decline of the Empire in respect of territorial
greatness and military strength, and likewise its deterioration in
regard to administrative vigor and national spirit. With him commenced
the corruption of the Court&mdash;the fatal evil, which almost universally
weakens and destroys Oriental dynasties. His expedition against Greece
exhausted and depopulated the Empire; and though, by abstaining from
further military enterprises, he did what lay in his power to recruit
its strength, still the losses which his expedition caused were
certainly not repaired in his lifetime.
</p>
<p>
As a builder, Xerxes showed something of the same grandeur of conception
which is observable in his great military enterprise and in the works by
which it was accompanied. His Propylaea, and the sculptured staircase in
front of the Chebl Minar, which is undoubtedly his work, are among the
most magnificent erections upon the Persepolitan platform; and are quite
sufficient to place him in the foremost rank of Oriental builders. If
we were to ascribe the Chehl Minar itself to him, we should have to give
him the palm above all other kings of Persia; but on the whole it
is most probable that that edifice and its duplicate at Susa were
conceived, and in the main, constructed, by Darius.
</p>
<p>
Xerxes left behind him three sons&mdash;Darius, Hystaspes, and
Artaxerxes&mdash;and two daughters, Amytis and Rhodogune. Hystaspes was
satrap of Bactria, and at the time of their father's death, only Darius
and Artaxerxes were at the Court.
</p>
<p>
Fearing the eldest son most, Artabanus persuaded Artaxerxes that the
assassination of Xerxes was the act of his brother, whereupon Artaxerxes
caused him to be put to death, and himself ascended the throne (B.C.
465).
</p>
<p>
Troubles, as usual, accompanied this irregular accession. Artabanus, not
content with exercising an influence under Artaxerxes such as has
caused some authors to speak of him as king, aimed at removing the
young prince, and making himself actual monarch. But his designs being
betrayed to Artaxerxes by Megabyzus, and at the same time his
former crimes coming to light, he was killed, together with his tool
Aspamitres, seven months after the murder of Xerxes. The sons of
Artabanus sought to avenge his death, but were defeated by Megabyzus in
an engagement, wherein they lost their lives.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, in Bactria, Hystaspes, who had a rightful claim to the
throne, raised the standard of revolt. Artaxerxes marched against him
in person, and engaged him in two battles, the first of which was
indecisive, while in the second the Bactrians suffered defeat, chiefly
(according to Ctesias) because the wind blew violently in their faces.
So signal was victory, that Bactria at once submitted. Hystaspes' fate
is uncertain.
</p>
<p>
Not long after the reduction of Bactria, Egypt suddenly threw off the
Persian yoke (B.C. 460). Inarus, a king of the wild African tribes who
bordered the Nile valley on the west, but himself perhaps a descendant
of the old monarchs of Egypt, led the insurrection, and, in conjunction
with an Egyptian, named Amyrtseus, attacked the Persian troops stationed
in the country, who were commanded by Achaemenes, the satrap. A battle
was fought near Papremis in the Delta, wherein the Persians were
defeated, and Achaemenes fell by the hand of Inarus himself. The
Egyptians generally now joined in the revolt; and the remnant of the
Persian army was shut up in Memphis. Inarus had asked the aid of Athens;
and an Athenian fleet of 200 sail was sent to his assistance. This fleet
sailed up the Nile, defeated a Persian squadron, and took part in the
capture of Memphis and the siege of its citade (White Castle). When
the Persian king first learned what had happened, he endeavored to rid
himself of his Athenian enemies by inducing the Spartans to invade their
country; but, failing in his attempt, he had recourse to arms, and,
levying a vast host, which he placed under the command of Megabyzus,
sent that officer to recover the revolted province. Megabyzus marched
upon Memphis, defeated the Egyptians and their allies in a great battle,
relieved the citadel of Memphis from its siege, and recovered the rest
of the town. The Athenians fled to the tract called Prosopitis, which
was a a portion of the Delta, completely surrounded by two branch
streams of the Nile. Here they were besieged for eighteen months, till
Megabyzus contrived to turn the water from one of the two streams,
whereby the Athenian ships were stranded, and the Persian troops were
able to march across the river bed, and overwhelm the Athenians with
their numbers. A few only escaped to Cyrene. The entire fleet fell into
the enemy's hands; and a reinforcement of fifty more ships, arriving
soon after the defeat, was attacked unawares after it had entered the
river, and lost more than half its number. Inarus was betrayed by some
of his own men, and, being carried prisoner to Persia, suffered death by
crucifixion. Amyrtseus fled to the fens, where for a while he maintained
his independence. Egypt, however, was with this exception recovered to
the Empire (B.C. 455); and Athens was taught that she could not always
invade the dominions of the Great King with impunity.
</p>
<p>
Six years after this, the Athenians resolved on another effort. A fleet
of 200 ships was equipped and placed under the command of the victor
of the Eurymedon, Cimon, with orders to proceed into the Eastern
Mediterranean, and seek to recover the laurels lost in Egypt. Cimon
sailed to Cyprus, where he received a communication from Amyrtseus,
which induced him to dispatch sixty ships to Egypt, while with the
remaining one hundred and forty he commenced the siege of Citium. Here
he died, either of disease or from the effects of a wound; and his
armament, pressed for provisions, was forced soon afterwards to raise
the siege, and address itself to some other enterprise. Sailing past
Salamis, it found there a Cilician and Phoenician fleet, consisting of
300 vessels, which it immediately attacked and defeated, notwithstanding
the disparity of number. Besides the ships which were sunk, a hundred
triremes were taken; and the sailors then landed and gained a victory
over a Persian army upon the shore. Artaxerxes, upon this, fearing lest
he should lose Cyprus altogether, and thinking that, if Athens became
mistress of this important island, she would always be fomenting
insurrection in Egypt, made overtures for peace to the generals who were
now in command. His propositions were favorably received. Peace was made
on the following terms:&mdash;Athens agreed to relinquish Cyprus, and recall
her squadron from Egypt; while the king consented to grant freedom to
all the Greek cities on the Asiatic continent, and not to menace them
either by land or water. The sea was divided between the two powers,
Persian ships of war were not to sail to the west of Phaselis in the
Levant, or of the Cyanean islands in the Euxine; and Greek war-ships, we
may assume, were not to show themselves east of those limits. On these
conditions there was to be peace and amity between the Greeks and the
Persians, and neither nation was to undertake any expeditions against
the territories of the other. Thus terminated the first period of
hostility between Greece and Persia, a period of exactly half a century,
commencing B.C. 499 and. ending B.C. 449, in the seventeenth year of
Artaxerxes.
</p>
<p>
It was probably not many years after the conclusion of this peace that
a rebellion broke out in Syria. Megabyzus, the satrap of that important
province, offended at the execution of Inarus, in violation of the
promise which he had himself made to him, raised a revolt against
his sovereign, defeated repeatedly the armies sent to reduce him to
obedience, and finally treated with Artaxerxes as to the terms on which
he would consent to be reconciled. Thus was set an example, if not of
successful insurrection, yet at any rate of the possibility of rebelling
with impunity&mdash;an example which could not fail to have a mischievous
effect on the future relations of the monarch with his satraps. It
would have been better for the Empire had Megabyzus suffered the fate
of Oroetes, instead of living to a good old age in high favor with the
monarch whose power he had weakened and defied.
</p>
<p>
Artaxerxes survived the "Peace of Callias" twenty-four years. His
relations with the Greeks continued friendly till his demise, though,
on the occasion of the revolt of Samos (B.C. 440), Pissuthnes, satrap of
Sardis, seems to have transgressed the terms of the treaty, and to
have nearly brought about a renewal of hostilities. It was probably
in retaliation for the aid given to the revolted Samians, that the
Athenians, late in the reign of Artaxerxes, made an expedition against
Caunus, which might have had important consequences, if the Caunians
had not been firm in their allegiance. A revolt of Lycia and Caria under
Zopyrus, the son of Megabyzus, assisted by the Greeks, might have proved
even more difficult to subdue than the rebellion of Syria under his
father. Persia, however, escaped this danger; and Artaxerxes, no doubt,
saw with pleasure a few years later the Greeks turn their arms against
each other&mdash;Athens, his great enemy, being forced into a contest for
existence with the Peloponnesian confederacy under Sparta.
</p>
<p>
The character of Artaxerxes, though it receives the approval of Plutarch
and Diodorus, must be pronounced on the whole poor and contemptible.
His ready belief of the charge brought by Artabanus against his brother,
Darius, admits perhaps of excuse, owing to his extreme youth; but his
surrender of Inarus to Amestris on account of her importunity, his
readiness to condone the revolt of Megabyzus, and his subjection
throughout almost the whole of his life to the evil influence of Amytis,
his sister, and Amestris, his mother&mdash;both persons of ill-regulated
lives&mdash;are indications of weakness and folly quite unpardonable in
a monarch. That he was mild in temperament, and even kind and
good-natured, is probable. But he had no other quality that deserves the
slightest commendation. In the whole course of his long reign he seems
never once to have adventured himself in the field against an enemy.
He made not a single attempt at conquest in any direction. We have no
evidence that he patronized either literature or the arts. His peace
with Athens was necessary perhaps, but disgraceful to Persia. The
disorders of the Court increased under his reign, from the license
(especially) which he allowed the Queen-mother, who sported with the
lives of his subjects. The decay of the Empire received a fatal impulse
from the impunity which he permitted to Megabyzus.
</p>
<p>
Like his father, Artaxerxes appears to have had but one legitimate wife.
This was a certain Damaspia, of whom nothing is known, except that she
died on the same day as her husband, and was the mother of his only
legitimate son, Xerxes. Seventeen other sons, who survived him, were
the issue of various concubines, chiefly&mdash;it would appear&mdash;Babylonians.
Xerxes II. succeeded to the throne on the death of his father (B.C.
425), but reigned forty-five days only, being murdered after a festival,
in which he had indulged too freely, by his half-brother, Secydianus or
Sogdianus. Secydianus enjoyed the sovereignty for little more than half
a year, when he was in his turn put to death by another, brother, Ochus,
who on ascending the throne took the name of Darius, and became known to
the Greeks as Darius Nothus.
</p>
<p>
Darius Nothus had in his father's lifetime been made satrap of Hyrcania,
and had married his aunt, Parysatis, a daughter of Xerxes. He had
already two children at his accession,&mdash;a daughter, Amestris, and a
son, Arsaces, who succeeded him as Artaxerxes. His reign, which lasted
nineteen years, was a constant scene of insurrections and revolts, some
of which were of great importance, since they had permanent and
very disastrous consequences. The earliest of all was raised by his
full-brother, Arsites, who rebelled in conjunction with a son of
Megabyzus, and, obtaining the support of a number of Greek mercenaries,
gained two victories over the forces dispatched against him by the king.
At last, however, the fortune of war changed. Persian gold was used
to corrupt the mercenaries; and the rebels being thus reduced to
extremities, were forced to capitulate, yielding themselves on the
condition that their lives should be spared. Parysatis induced her
husband to disregard the pledges given and execute both Arsites and his
fellow-conspirator&mdash;thus proclaiming to the world that, unless by the
employment of perfidy, the Empire was incapable of dealing with those
who rebelled against its authority.
</p>
<p>
The revolt of Pissuthnes, satrap of Lydia, was the next important
outbreak. Its exact date is uncertain; but it seems not to have very
long preceded the Athenian disasters in Sicily. Pissuthnes, who had held
his satrapy for more than twenty years, was the son of a Hystaspes, and
probably a member of the royal family. His wealth&mdash;the accumulations of
so long a term of office&mdash;enabled him to hire the services of a body of
Greek mercenaries, who were commanded by an Athenian, called Lycon. On
these troops he placed his chief dependence; but they failed him in the
hour of need. Tissaphernes, the Persian general sent against him, bribed
Lycon and his men, who thereupon quitted Pissuthnes and made common
cause with his adversaries. The unfortunate satrap could no longer
resist, and therefore surrendered upon terms, and accompanied
Tissaphernes to the Court. Darius, accustomed now to disregard the
pledged word of his officers, executed him forthwith, and made over his
satrapy to Tissaphernes, as a reward for his zeal. Lycon, the Athenian
traitor, received likewise a handsome return for his services, the
revenues of several towns and districts being assigned him by the Great
King.
</p>
<p>
The rebellion, however, was not wholly crushed by the destruction of
its author, Amorges, a bastard son of Pissuthnes, continued to maintain
himself in Caria, where he was master of the strong city of Iasus, on
the north coast of the Sinus Iasicus, and set the power of Tissaphernes
at defiance. Having probably inherited the wealth of his father, he
hired a number of Peloponnesian mercenaries, and succeeded in maintaining
himself as an independent monarch for some years.
</p>
<p>
Such was the condition of things in Asia Minor, when intelligence
arrived of the fearful disasters which had befallen the Athenians in
Sicily&mdash;disasters without a parallel since those of Salamis&mdash;sudden,
unexpected, overwhelming. The news, flying through Asia, awoke
everywhere a belief that the power of Athens was broken, and that her
hostility need no longer be dreaded. The Persian monarch considered that
under the altered circumstances it would be safe to treat the Peace of
Callias as a dead letter, and sent down orders to the satraps of Lydia
and Bithynia that they were once more to demand and collect the tribute
of the Greek cities within their provinces. The satraps began to
speculate on the advantages which they might derive from alliance with
the enemies of Athens, and looked anxiously to see a Peloponnesian fleet
appear off the coast of Asia. Tissaphernes and Pharnabazus vied with
each other in the tempting offers which they made to Sparta, and it was
not long before a formal treaty was concluded between that state
and Persia, by which the two powers bound themselves to carry on war
conjointly against Athens.
</p>
<p>
Thus the contest between Persia and her rival entered upon a new phase.
Henceforth until the liberties of Greece were lost, the Great King could
always count on having for his ally one of the principal Grecian powers.
His gold was found to possess attractions which the Greeks were quite
unable to resist. At one time Sparta, at another Athens, at another
Thebes yielded to the subtle influence; Greek generals commanded the
Persian armies; Greek captains manoeuvered the Persian fleets; the very
rank and file of the standing army came to be almost as much Greek as
Persian. Acting on the maxim, <i>Divide et impera</i>, Persia prolonged for
eighty years her tottering Empire, by the skilful use which she made of
the mutual jealousies and divisions of the Hellenic states.
</p>
<p>
It scarcely belongs to the history of Persia to trace in detail the
fortunes of the contending powers during the latter portion of the
Peloponnesian war. We need only observe that the real policy of the
Court of Susa, well understood, and, on the whole, tolerably well
carried out by the satraps, was to preserve the balance of power
between Athens and Sparta, to allow neither to obtain too decided a
preponderance, to help each in turn, and encourage each to waste the
other's strength, but to draw back whenever the moment came for striking
a decisive blow against either side. This policy skilfully pursued
by Tissaphernes (who had a genius for intrigue and did not require
an Alcibiades to give him lessons in state-craft), more clumsily
by Pharnabazus, whose character was comparatively sincere and
straightforward, prevailed until the younger Cyrus made his appearance
upon the scene, when a disturbing force came into play which had
disastrous effects both on the fortunes of Greece and on those of
Persia. The younger Cyrus had personal views of self-aggrandizement
which conflicted with the true interests of his nation, and was so bent
on paving the way for his own ascent to sovereign power that he did not
greatly care whether he injured his country or no. As the accomplishment
of his designs depended mainly on his obtaining a powerful land-force,
he regarded a Spartan as preferable to an Athenian alliance; and, having
once made his choice, he lent his ally such effectual aid that in
two years from the time of his coming down to the coast the war was
terminated. Persian gold manned and partly built the fleet which
conquered at AEgos-Potami; perhaps it contributed in a still more
decisive manner to the victory. Cyrus, by placing his stores at the
entire command of Lysander, deserved and acquired the cordial good-will
of Sparta and the Peloponnesians generally&mdash;an advantage of which we
shall find him in the sequel making good use.
</p>
<p>
The gain to Persia from the dominion which she had reacquired over the
Greeks of Asia was more than counter-balanced by a loss of territory in
another quarter, which seems to have occurred during the reign of Darius
Nothus, though in what exact year is doubtful. The revolt of Egypt is
placed by Heeren and Clinton in B.C. 414, by Eusebius in B.C. 411, by
Manetho in the last year of Darius Nothus, or B.C. 405. The earlier
dates depend on the view that the Amyrtseus of Manetho's twenty-eighth
dynasty was the leader of the rebellion, and had a reign of six years
at this period&mdash;a view which is perhaps unsound. Manetho probably
represented Nepherites (Nefaorot) as the leader; and it is quite clear
that he placed the re-establishment of the old throne of the Pharaohs in
the year that Darius Nothus died. As his authority is the best that we
can obtain upon this obscure point, we may regard the last days of
the Persian monarch as clouded by news of a rebellion, which had been
perhaps for some time contemplated, but which did not break out until he
was known to be in a moribund condition.
</p>
<p>
A few years earlier, B.C. 408 or 409, the Medes had made an unsuccessful
attempt to recover their independence. The circumstances of this revolt,
which is mentioned by no writer but Xenophon, are wholly unknown, but we
may perhaps connect it with the rebellion of Terituchmes, a son-in-law
of the king. The story of Terituchmes, which belongs to this period,
deserves at any rate to be told, as illustrating, in a very remarkable
way, the corruption, cruelty, and dissoluteness of the Persian Court at
the time to which we have now come. Terituchmes was the son of Idernes,
a Persian noble of high rank, probably a descendant of the conspirator
Hydarnes. On the death of his father, he succeeded to his satrapy, as
to a hereditary fief, and being high in favor with Darius Nothus, he
received in marriage that monarch's daughter, Amestris. Having, however,
after his marriage become enamored of his own half-sister, Roxana, and
having persuaded her to an incestuous commerce, he grew to detest his
wife, and as he could not rid himself of her without making an enemy of
the king, he entered into a conspiracy with 300 others, and planned to
raise a rebellion. The bond of a common crime, cruel and revolting in
its character, was to secure the fidelity of the rebels one to another.
Amestris was to be placed in a sack, and each conspirator in turn was
to plunge his sword into her body. It is not clear whether this intended
murder was executed or no. Hoping to prevent it, Darius commissioned
a certain Udiastes, who was in the service of Terituchmes, to save his
daughter by any means that might be necessary; and Udiastes, collecting
a band, set upon Terituchmes and slew him after a strenuous resistance.
After this, his mother, brothers, and sisters were apprehended by the
order of Parysatis, the queen, who caused Roxana to be hewn in pieces,
and the other unfortunates to be buried alive. It was with great
difficulty that Arsaces, the heir-apparent, afterwards Artaxerxes
Mnemon, preserved his own wife, Statira, from the massacre. It happened
that she was sister to Terituchmes, and, though wholly innocent of his
offence, she would have been involved in the common destruction of her
family had not her husband with tears and entreaties begged her life of
his parents. The son of Terituchmes maintained himself for a while in
his father's government; but Parysatis succeeded in having him taken off
by poison.
</p>
<p>
The character of Darius Nothus is seen tolerably clearly in the account
of his reign which has been here given. He was at once weak and wicked.
Contrary to his sworn word, he murdered his brothers, Secydianus and
Arsites. He broke faith with Pissuthnes. He sanctioned the wholesale
execution of Terituchmes' relatives. Under him the eunuchs of the palace
rose to such power that one of them actually ventured to aspire to the
sovereignty. Parysatis, his wife, one of the most cruel and malignant
even of Oriental women, was in general his chosen guide and counsellor.
His severities cannot, however, in all eases be ascribed to her
influence, for he was anxious that she should put the innocent Statira
to death, and, when she refused, reproached her with being foolishly
lenient. In his administration of the Empire he was unsuccessful; for,
if he gained some tracts of Asia Minor, he lost the entire African
satrapy. Under him we trace a growing relaxation of the checks by which
the great officers of the state were intended to have been held
under restraint. Satraps came to be practically uncontrolled in their
provinces, and the dangerous custom arose of allowing sons to succeed,
almost as a matter of course, to the governments of their fathers.
Powers unduly large were lodged in the hands of a single officer, and
actions, that should have brought down upon their perpetrators sharp
and signal punishment, were timorously or negligently condoned by the
supreme authority. Cunning and treachery were made the weapons wherewith
Persia contended with her enemies. Manly habits were laid aside, and the
nation learned to trust more and more to the swords of mercenaries.
</p>
<p>
Shortly before the death of Darius there seems to have been a doubt
raised as to the succession. Parysatis, who preferred her second son to
her first-born, imagined that her influence was sufficient to induce her
husband to nominate Cyrus, instead of Arsaces, to succeed him; and Cyrus
is said to have himself expected to be preferred above his brother. He
had the claim, if claim it can be called, that he was the first son
born to his father after he became king; but his main dependence was
doubtless on his mother. Darius, however, proved less facile in his
dying moments than he had been during most of his life, and declined
to set aside the rights of the eldest son on the frivolous pretence
suggested to him. His own feelings may have inclined him towards
Arsaces, who resembled him far more than Cyrus did in character; and
Cyrus, moreover, had recently offended him, and been summoned to court,
to answer a very serious charge. Arsaces, therefore, was nominated, and
took the name of Artaxerxes&mdash;as one of a king who had reigned long, and,
on the whole, prosperously.
</p>
<p>
An incident of ill omen accompanied the commencement of the new reign
(B.C. 405). The inauguration of the monarch was a religious ceremony,
and took place in a temple at Pasargadae, the old capital, to which
a peculiar sanctity was still regarded as attaching. Artaxerxes had
proceeded to this place, and was about to engage in the ceremonies, when
he was interrupted by Tissaphernes, who informed him that his life was
in danger. Cyrus, he said, proposed to hide himself in the temple,
and assassinate him as he changed his dress, a necessary part of the
formalities. One of the officiating priests&mdash;a Magus, as it would
seem&mdash;confirmed the charge. Cyrus was immediately arrested, and would
have been put to death on the spot, had not his mother interfered, and,
embracing him in her arms, made it impossible for the executioner to
perform his task. With some difficulty she persuaded Artaxerxes to spare
his brother's life and allow him to return to his government, assuring
him, and perhaps believing, that the charges made against her favorite
were without foundation.
</p>
<p>
Cyrus returned to Asia Minor with the full determination of attacking
his brother at the earliest opportunity. He immediately began the
collection of a mercenary force, composed wholly of Greeks, on whose
arms he was disposed to place far more reliance than on those of
Orientals. As Tissaphernes had returned to the coast with him, and was
closely watching all his proceedings, it was necessary to exercise great
caution, lest his intentions should become known before he was ready to
put them into execution. He therefore had recourse to three different
devices. Having found a cause of quarrel with Tissaphernes in the
ambiguous terms of their respective commissions, he pressed it on to
an actual war, which enabled him to hire troops openly, as against this
enemy; and in this way he collected from 5000 to 6000 Greeks&mdash;chiefly
Peloponnesians. He further gave secret commissions to Greek officers,
whose acquaintance he had made when he was previously in these parts,
to collect men for him, whom they were to employ in their own quarrels
until he needed their services. From 3000 to 4000 troops were gathered
for him by these persons. Finally, when he found himself nearly ready
to commence his march, he discovered a new foe in the Pisidians of
the Western Taurus, and proceeded to levy a force against them, which
amounted to some thousands more. In all, he had in readiness 11,000
heavy-armed and about 2000 light-armed Greeks before his purpose became
so clear that Tissaphernes could no longer mistake it, and therefore
started off to carry his somewhat tardy intelligence to the capital.
</p>
<p>
The aims of Cyrus were different from those of ordinary rebel satraps;
and we must go back to the times of Darius Hystaspis in order to find a
parallel to them. Instead of seeking to free a province from the Persian
yoke, or to carve out for himself an independent sovereignty in some
remote corner of the Empire, his intention was to dethrone his brother,
and place on his own brows the diadem of his great namesake. It was
necessary for him therefore to assume the offensive. Only by a bold
advance, and by taking his enemy to some extent unprepared, and so at a
disadvantage, could he hope to succeed in his audacious project. It is
not easy to see that he could have had any considerable party among
the Persians, or any ground for expecting to be supported by any of
the subject nations. His following must have been purely personal; and
though it may be true that he was of a character to win more admiration
and affection than his brother, yet Artaxerxes himself was far from
being unpopular with his subjects, whom he pleased by a familiarity and
a good-nature to which they were little accustomed. Cyrus knew that
his principal dependence must be on himself, on his Greeks, and on the
carelessness and dilatoriness of his adversary, who was destitute of
military talent and was even thought to be devoid of personal bravery.
</p>
<p>
Thus it was important to advance as soon as possible. Cyrus therefore
quitted Sardis before all his troops were collected (B.C. 401), and
marched through Lydia and Phrygia, by the route formally followed in the
reverse direction by the army of Xerxes, as far as Celsense, where
the remainder of his mercenaries joined him. With his Greek force thus
raised to 13,000 men, and with a native army not much short of 100,000,
he proceeded on through Phrygia and Lycaonia to the borders of Cilicia,
having determined on taking the shortest route to Babylon, through the
Cilician and Syrian passes, and then along the course of the Euphrates.
At Caystrupedion he was met by Epyaxa, consort of Syennesis, the
tributary king of Cilicia, who brought him a welcome supply of money,
and probably assured him of the friendly disposition of her husband, who
was anxious to stand well with both sides. In Lycaonia, Cyrus divided
his forces, and sending a small body of troops under Menon to escort
Epyaxa across the mountains and enter Cilicia by the more western of the
two practicable passes he proceeded himself with the bulk of his troops
to the famous Pylae Cilicias, where he probably knew that Syennesis
would only make a feint of resistance. He found the pass occupied; but
it was evacuated the next day, on the receipt of intelligence that Menon
had already entered the country and that the fleet of Cyrus&mdash;composed
partly of his own ships, partly of a squadron furnished to him by
Sparta&mdash;had appeared off the coast and threatened a landing. Cyrus
thus crossed the most difficult and dangerous of all the passes that
separated him from the heart of the Empire, without the loss of a man.
</p>
<p>
Thus far it would appear that Cyrus had to a certain extent masked his
plans. The Greek captains must have guessed, if they had not actually
learnt, his intentions; but to the bulk of the soldiery they had been
hitherto absolutely unknown. It was only in Cilicia that the light broke
in upon them, and they began to suspect that they were being marched
into the interior of Asia, there to engage in a contest with the entire
power of the Great King. Something of the horror which is ascribed to
Cleomenes, when it was suggested to him a century earlier that he should
conduct his Spartans the distance of a three months' journey from the
sea, appears to have taken possession of the minds of the mercenaries
on their awaking to this conviction. They at once refused to proceed. It
was only by the most skilful management on the part of their captains,
joined to a judicious liberality on the part of Cyrus, that they were
induced to forego their intention of returning home at once, and so
breaking up the expedition. A perception of the difficulty of effecting
a retreat, together with an increase of pay, extorted a reluctant assent
to continue the march, of which the real term and object were even now
not distinctly avowed. Cyrus said he proposed to attack the army of
Abrocomas, which he believed to be posted on the Euphrates. If he did
not find it there, a fresh consultation might be held to consider any
further movement.
</p>
<p>
The march now proceeded rapidly. The gates of Syria&mdash;a narrow pass on
the east coast of the Gulf of Issus, shut in, like Thermopylae,
between the mountains and the sea, and strengthened moreover by
fortifications&mdash;were left unguarded by Abrocomas; and the army, having
traversed them without loss, crossed the Amanus range by the pass of
Beilan, and in twenty-nine days from Tarsus reached Thapsacus on
the Euphrates. The forces of Artaxerxes had nowhere made their
appearance&mdash;Abrocomas, though he had 300,000 men at his disposal, had
weakly or treacherously abandoned all these strong and easily defensible
positions; he does not seem even to have wasted the country; but,
having burnt the boats at Thapsacus, he was content to fall back upon
Phoenicia, and left the way to Babylon and Susa open. At Thapsacus there
was little difficulty in persuading the Greeks, who had no longer the
sea before their eyes, to continue the march; they only stipulated for a
further increase of pay, which was readily promised them by the sanguine
prince, who believed himself on the point of obtaining by their aid the
inexhaustible treasures of the Empire. The river, which happened to be
unusually low for the time of year, was easily forded. Cyrus entered
Mesopotamia, and continued his march down the left bank of the Euphrates
at the quickest rate that it was possible to move a hundred thousand
Orientals. In thirty-three days he had accomplished above 600 miles, and
had approached within 120 miles of Babylon without seeing any traces
of an enemy. His only difficulties were from the nature of the country,
which, after the Khabour is passed, becomes barren, excepting close
along the river. From want of fodder there was a great mortality among
the baggage-animals; the price of grain rose; and the Greeks had to
subsist almost entirely upon meat. At last, when the Babylonian alluvium
was reached, with its abundance of fodder and corn, signs of the enemy
began to be observed. Artaxerxes, who after some doubts and misgivings
had finally determined to give his enemy battle in the plain, was
already on his way from Babylon, with an army reckoned at 900,000 men
and had sent forward a body of horse, partly to reconnoitre, partly
to destroy the crops, in order to prevent Cyrus and his troops from
benefiting by them. Cyrus now advanced slowly and cautiously, at the
rate of about fourteen miles a day, expecting each morning to fight a
general engagement before evening came. On the third night, believing
the battle to be imminent, he distributed the commands and laid down a
plan of operations. But morning brought no appearance of the enemy, and
the whole day passed tranquilly. In the course of it, he came upon a
wide and deep trench cut through the plain for a distance of above forty
miles&mdash;a recent work, which Artaxerxes had intended as a barrier to stop
the progress of his enemy. But the trench was undefended and incomplete,
a space of twenty feet being left between its termination and the
Euphrates. Cyrus, having passed it, began to be convinced that his
brother would not risk a battle in the plain, but would retreat to the
mountains and make his stand at Persepolis or Ecbatana. He therefore
continued his march negligently. His men piled their arms on the wagons
or laid them, across the beasts of burthen; while he himself exchanged
the horse which he usually rode for a chariot, and proceeded on his way
leisurely, having about his person a small escort, which preserved
their ranks, while all the rest of the troops were allowed to advance in
complete disarray.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly, as the army was proceeding in this disorderly manner through
the plain, a single horseman was perceived advancing at full gallop from
the opposite quarter, his steed all flecked with foam. As he drew near,
he shouted aloud to those whom he met, addressing some in Greek, others
in Persian, and warning them that the Great King, with his whole force,
was close at hand, and rapidly approaching in order of battle. The news
took every one by surprise, and at first all was hurry and confusion.
The Greeks, however, who were on the right, rapidly marshalled their
line, resting it upon the river; while Cyrus put on his armor, mounted
his horse, and arranged the ranks of his Asiatics. Ample time was given
for completing all the necessary dispositions; since three hours, at the
least, must have elapsed from the announcement of the enemy's approach
before he actually appeared. Then a white cloud of dust arose towards
the verge of the horizon, below which a part of the plain began soon to
darken; presently gleams of light were seen to flash out from the dense
mass which was advancing, the serried lines of spears came into view,
and the component parts of the huge army grew to be discernible. On the
extreme left was a body of horsemen with white cuirasses, commanded by
Tissaphernes; next came infantry, carrying the long wicker shield, or
<i>gerrhum</i> then a solid square of Egyptians, heavily armed, and bearing
wooden shields that reached to the feet; then the contingents of many
different nations, some on foot, some on horseback, armed with bows
and other weapons. The line stretched away to the east further than the
Greeks, who were stationed on the right, could see, extending (as it
would seem) more than twice the distance which was covered by the
army of Cyrus. Artaxerxes was in the centre of his line, on horseback,
surrounded by a mounted guard of 6000 Persians. In front of the line,
towards the river, were drawn up at wide intervals a hundred and fifty
scythed chariots, which were designed to carry terror and confusion into
the ranks of the Greeks.
</p>
<p>
On the other side, Cyrus had upon the extreme right a thousand
Paphlagonian cavalry with the more lightly armed of the Greeks;
next, the Greek heavy-armed, under Clearchus; and then his Asiatics,
stretching in a line to about the middle of his adversary's army, his
own special command being in the centre; and his left wing being led
by the satrap, Ariaeus. With Ariseus was posted the great mass of the
cavalry; but a band of six hundred, clad in complete armor, with their
horses also partially armed, waited on Cyrus himself, and accompanied
him wherever he went. As the enemy drew near, and Cyrus saw how much he
was outflanked upon the left, he made an attempt to remedy the evil by
ordering Clearchus to move with his troops from the extreme right to
the extreme left of the line, where he would be opposite to Artaxerxes
himself. This, no doubt, would have been a hazardous movement to make in
the face of a superior enemy; and Clearchus, feeling this, and regarding
the execution of the order as left to his discretion, declined to move
away from the river. Cyrus, who trusted much to the Greek general's
judgment, did not any further press the change, but prepared to fight
the battle as he stood.
</p>
<p>
The combat began upon the right. When the enemy had approached within
six or seven hundred yards, the impatience of the Greeks to engage could
not be restrained. They sang the paean and started forwards at a pace
which in a short time became a run. The Persians did not await their
charge. The drivers leaped from their chariots, the line of battle
behind them wavered, and then turned and fled without striking a blow.
One Greek only was wounded by an arrow. As for the scythed chariots,
they damaged their own side more than the Greeks; for the frightened
horses in many cases, carried the vehicles into the thick of the
fugitives, while the Greeks opened their ranks and gave passage to such
as charged in an opposite direction. Moderating their pace so as to
preserve their tactical arrangement, but still advancing with great
rapidity, the Greeks pressed on the flying enemy, and pursued him a
distance of two or three miles, never giving a thought to Cyrus, who,
they supposed, would conquer those opposed to him with as much ease as
themselves.
</p>
<p>
But the prince meanwhile was in difficulties. Finding himself
outnumbered and outflanked, and fearing that his whole army would be
surrounded, and even the victorious Greeks attacked in the rear, he set
all upon one desperate cast and charged with his Six Hundred against
the six thousand horse who protected his brother. Artagerses, their
commander, who met him with a Homeric invective, he slew with his own
hand. The six thousand were routed and took to flight; the person of the
king was exposed to view; and Cyrus, transported at the sight, rushed
forward shouting, "I see the man," and hurling his javelin, struck him
straight upon the breast, with such force that the cuirass was pierced
and a slight flesh-wound inflicted. The king fell from his horse; but at
the same moment Cyrus received a wound beneath the eye from the javelin
of a Persian, and in the melee which followed he was slain with eight of
his followers. The Six Hundred could lend no effectual aid, because they
had rashly dispersed in pursuit of the flying enemy.
</p>
<p>
As the whole contest was a personal one, the victory was now decided.
Fighting, however, continued till nightfall. On learning the death of
their leader, the Asiatic troops under Ariseus fled&mdash;first to their
camp, and then, when Artaxerxes attacked them there, to the last night's
station. The Grecian camp was assaulted by Tissaphernes, who at the
beginning of the battle had charged through the Greek light-armed,
without however, inflicting on them any loss, and had then pressed on,
thinking to capture the Grecian baggage. But the guard defended their
camp with success, and slew many of the assailants. Tissaphernes and
the king drew off after a while, and retraced their steps, in order to
complete the victory by routing the troops of Clearchus. Clearchus was
at the same time returning from his pursuit, having heard that his camp
was in danger, and as the two bodies of troops approached, he found
his right threatened by the entire host of the enemy, which might have
lapped round it and attacked it in front, in flank, and in rear. To
escape this peril he was about to wheel his line and make it rest
alone its whole extent upon the river, when the Persians passed him and
resumed the position which they had occupied at the beginning of the
battle. They were then about to attack, when once more the Greeks
anticipated them and charged. The effect was again ludicrous. The
Persians would not abide the onset, but fled faster than before. The
Greeks pursued them to a village, close by which was a knoll or mound,
whither the fugitives had betaken themselves. Again the Greeks made a
movement in advance, and immediately the flight recommenced. The last
rays of the setting sun fell on scattered masses of Persian horse and
foot flying in all directions over the plain from the little band of
Greeks.
</p>
<p>
The battle of Cunaxa was a double blow to the Persian power. By the
death of Cyrus there was lost the sole chance that existed of such a
re-invigoration of the Empire as might have enabled it to start again
on a new lease of life, with ability to held its own, and strength to
resume once more the aggressive attitude of former times. The talents of
Cyrus have perhaps been overrated, but he was certainly very superior
to most Orientals; and there can be no doubt that the Empire would have
greatly gained by the substitution of his rule for that of his brother.
He was active, energetic, prompt indeed, ready in speech, faithful in
the observance of his engagements, brave, liberal&mdash;he had more foresight
and more self-contro than most Asiatics; he knew how to deal with
different classes of men; he had a great power of inspiring affection
and retaining it; he was free from the folly of national prejudice,
and could appreciate as they deserved both the character and the
institutions of foreigners. It is likely that he would have proved a
better administrator and ruler than any king of Persia since Darius
Hystaspis. He would, therefore, undoubtedly have raised his country
to some extent. Whether he could really have arrested its decline, and
enabled it to avenge the humiliations of Marathon, Salamis, and the
peace of Callias, is, however, exceedingly doubtful. For Cyrus, though
he had considerable merits, was not without great and grievous defects.
As the Tartar is said always to underlie the Russ, so the true Oriental
underlay that coating of Grecian manners and modes of thought and act,
with which a real admiration of the Hellenic race induced Cyrus to
conceal his native barbarism. When he slew his cousins for an act which
he chose to construe as disrespect, and when he executed Orontes for
contemplated desertion, secretly and silently, so that no one knew
his fate, when transported with jealous rage he rushed madly upon his
brother, exposing to hazard the success of all his carefully formed
plans, and in fact ruining his cause, the acquired habits of the
Phil-Hellene gave way, and the native ferocity of the Asiatic came
to the surface. We see Cyrus under favorable circumstances, while
conciliation, tact, and self-restraint were necessities of his position,
without which he could not possibly gain his ends&mdash;we do not know what
effect success and the possession of supreme power might have had upon
his temper and conduct; but from the acts above-mentioned we may at any
rate suspect that the result would have been very injurious.
</p>
<p>
Again, intellectually, Cyrus is only great for an Asiatic. He has more
method, more foresight, more power of combination, more breadth of mind
than the other Asiatics of his day, or than the vast mass of Asiatics of
any day. But he is not entitled to the praise of a great administrator
or of a great general. His three years' administration of Asia Minor
was chiefly marked by a barbarous severity towards criminals, and by a
lavish expenditure of the resources of his government, which left him in
actual want at the moment when he was about to commence his expedition.
His generalship failed signally at the battle of Cunaxa, for the loss of
which he is far more to be blamed than Clearchus. As he well knew that
Artaxerxes was sure to occupy the centre of his line of battle, he
should have placed his Greeks in the middle of his own line, not at
one extremity. When he saw how much his adversary outflanked him on the
left&mdash;a contingency which was so probable that it ought to have occurred
to him beforehand&mdash;he should have deployed his line in that direction,
instead of ordering such a movement as Clearchus, not unwisely, declined
to execute. He might have trusted the Greeks to fight in line, as they
had fought at Marathon; and by expanding their ranks, and moving off
his Asiatics to the left, he might, have avoided the danger of being
outflanked and surrounded. But his capital error was the wildness
and abandon of his charge with the Six Hundred&mdash;a charge which it was
probably right to make under the circumstances, but which required a
combination of coolness and courage that the Persian prince evidently
did not possess when his feelings were excited. Had he kept his
Six Hundred well in hand, checked their pursuit, and abstained from
thrusting his own person into unnecessary danger, he might have joined
the Greeks as they returned from their first victory and participated
in their final triumph. At the same time, Clearchus cannot but be blamed
for pushing his suit too far. If, when the enemy in his front fled, he
had at once turned against those who were engaging Cyrus, taking them
on their left flank, which must have been completely uncovered, he might
have been in time to prevent the fatal results of the rash charge made
by his leader.
</p>
<p>
Thus the death of Cyrus, though a calamity to Persia, was scarcely the
great loss which it has been represented. A far worse result of the
Cyreian expedition was the revelation which it made of the weakness of
Persia, and of the facility with which a Greek force might penetrate
to the very midst of the Empire, defeat the largest army that could be
brought against it, and remain, or return, as it might think proper.
Hitherto Babylon and Susa had been, even to the mind of a Greek
statesman, remote localities, which it would be the extreme of rashness
to attempt to reach by force of arms, and from which it would be
utter folly to suppose that a single man could return alive except by
permission of the Great King. Henceforth these towns were looked upon
as prizes quite within the legitimate scope of Greek ambition, and their
conquest came to be viewed as little more than a question of time. The
opinion of inaccessibility, which had been Persia's safeguard hitherto,
was gone, and in its stead grew up a conviction that the heart of the
Empire might be reached with very little difficulty.
</p>
<p>
It required, however, for the production of this whole change, not
merely that the advance to Cunaxa should have been safely made, and the
immeasurable superiority of Greek to Asiatic soldiers there exhibited,
but also that the retreat should have been effected, as it was effected,
without disaster. Had the Ten Thousand perished under the attacks of the
Persian horse, or even under the weapons of the Kurds, or amid the
snows of Armenia, the opinion of Persian invulnerability would have been
strengthened rather than weakened by the expedition. But the return to
Greece of ten thousand men, who had defeated the hosts of the Great King
in the centre of his dominions, and fought their way back to the
sea without suffering more than the common casualties of war, was an
evidence of weakness which could not but become generally known, and of
which all could feel the force. Hence the retreat was as important as
the battle. If in late autumn and mid-winter a small Greek army, without
maps or guides, could make its way for a thousand miles through Asia,
and encounter no foe over whom it could not easily triumph, it was clear
that the fabric of Persian power was rotten, and would collapse on the
first serious attack.
</p>
<p>
Still, it will not be necessary to trace in detail the steps of the
retreat. It was the fact of the return, rather than the mode of its
accomplishment, which importantly affected the subsequent history of
Persia. We need only note that the retreat was successfully conducted in
spite, not merely of the military power of the Empire, but of the most
barefaced and cruel treachery&mdash;a fact which showed clearly the strong
desire that there was to hinder the invaders' escape. Persia did not
set much store by her honor at this period; but she would scarcely have
pledged her word and broken it, without the slightest shadow of excuse,
unless she had regarded the object to be accomplished as one of vast
importance, and seen no other way which offered any prospect of the
desired result. Her failure, despite the success of her treachery,
places her military weakness in the strongest possible light. The
Greeks, though deprived of their leaders, deceived, surprised, and
hemmed in by superior numbers, amid terrific mountains, precipices,
and snows, forced their way by sheer dogged perseverance through all
obstacles, and reached Trebizond with the loss of not one fourth of
their original number.
</p>
<p>
There was also another discovery made during the return which partly
indicated the weakness of the Persian power, and partly accounted for
it. The Greeks had believed that the whole vast space enclosed between
the Black Sea, Caucasus, Caspian, and Jaxartes on the one hand, and the
Arabian Desert, Persian Gulf, and Indian Ocean on the other, was bound
together into one single centralized monarchy, all the resources of
which were wielded by a single arm. They now found that even towards the
heart of the empire, on the confines of Media and Assyria, there existed
independent tribes which set the arms of Persia at defiance; while
towards the verge of the old dominion whole provinces, once certainly
held in subjection, had fallen away from the declining State, and
succeeded in establishing their freedom. The nineteenth satrapy of
Herodotus existed no more; in lieu of it was a mass of warlike and
autonomous tribes&mdash;Chalybes, Taochi, Chaldeans, Macronians, Scythians,
Colchians, Mosynoecians, Tibarenians&mdash;whose services, if he needed them,
the King of Persia had to buy, while ordinarily their attitude towards
him was one of distrust and hostility. Judging of the unknown from the
known, the Greeks might reasonably conclude that in all parts of
the Empire similar defections had occurred, and that thus both
the dimensions and the resources of the state had suffered serious
diminution, and fell far below the conception which they had been
accustomed to form of them.
</p>
<p>
The immediate consequence of the Cyreian expedition was a rupture
between Persia and Sparta. Sparta had given aid to Cyrus, and thus
provoked the hostility of the Great King. She was not inclined to
apologize or to recede. On the contrary, she saw in the circumstances
of the expedition strong grounds for anticipating great advantages
to herself from a war with so weak an antagonist. Having, therefore,
secured the services of the returned Ten Thousand, she undertook the
protection of the Asiatic Greeks against Persia, and carried on a war
upon the continent against the satraps of Lydia and Phrygia for the
space of six years (B.C. 399 to B.C. 394). The disorganization of the
Persian Empire became very manifest during this period. So jealous were
the two satraps of each other, that either was willing at any time
to make a truce with the Spartans on condition that they proceeded to
attack the other; and, on one occasion, as much as thirty silver talents
was paid by a satrap on the condition that the war should be transferred
from his own government to that, of his rival. At the same time the
native tribes were becoming more and more inclined to rebel. The Mysians
and Pisidians had for a long time been practically independent. Now the
Bithynians showed a disposition to shake off the Persian yoke, while
in Paphlagonia the native monarchs boldly renounced their allegiance.
Agesilaus, who carried on the war in Asia Minor for three years, knew
well how to avail himself of all these advantageous circumstances;
and it is not unlikely that he would have effected the separation
from Persia of the entire peninsula, had he been able to continue the
struggle a few years longer. But the league between Argos, Thebes, and
Corinth, which jealousy of Sparta caused and Persian gold promoted,
proved so formidable, that Agesilaus had to be summoned home: and
after his departure, Conon, in alliance with Pharnabazus, recovered the
supremacy of the sea for Athens, and greatly weakened Spartan influence
in Asia. Not content with this result, the two friends, in the year B.C.
393, sailed across the Egean, and the portentous spectacle of a Persian
fleet in Greek waters was once more seen&mdash;this time in alliance with
Athens! Descents were made upon the coasts of the Peloponnese, and the
island of Cythera was seized and occupied. The long walls of Athens were
rebuilt with Persian money, and all the enemies of Sparta were richly
subsidized. Sparta was made to feel that if she had been able at one
time to make the Great King tremble for his provinces, or even for
his throne, the King could at another reach her across the Egean, and
approach Sparta as nearly as she had, with the Cyreians, approached
Babylon.
</p>
<p>
The lesson of the year B.C. 393 was not thrown away on the Spartan
government. The leading men became convinced that unless they could
secure the neutrality of the Persians, Sparta must succumb to the
hostility of her Hellenic enemies. Under these circumstances they
devised, with much skill, a scheme likely to be acceptable to the
Persians, which would weaken their chief rivals in Greece&mdash;Athens and
Thebes&mdash;while it would leave untouched their own power. They proposed
a general peace, the conditions of which should be the entire
relinquishment of Asia to the Persians, and the complete autonomy of all
the Greek States in Europe. The first attempt to procure the acceptance
of these terms failed (B.C. 393); but six years later, after Antalcidas
had explained them at the Persian Court, Artaxerxes sent down an
ultimatum to the disputants, modifying the terms slightly as regarded
Athens, extending them as regarded himself so as to include the islands
of Clazomenae and Cyprus, and requiring their acceptance by all the
belligerents, on pain of their incurring his hostility. To this threat
all yielded. A Persian king may be excused if he felt it a proud
achievement thus to dictate a peace to the Greeks&mdash;a peace, moreover,
which annulled the treaty of Callias, and gave back absolutely into
his hands a province which had ceased to belong to his Empire more than
sixty years previously.
</p>
<p>
It was the more important to Artaxerxes that his relations with the
European Greeks should be put upon a peaceful footing, since all the
resources of the Empire were wanted for the repression of disturbances
which had some years previously broken out in Cyprus. The exact date
of the Cyprian revolt under Evagoras, the Greek tyrant of Salamis, is
uncertain; but there is evidence that, at least as early as B.C. 391, he
was at open war with the power of Persia, and had made an alliance
with the Athenians, who both in that year and in B.C. 388 sent him aid.
Assisted also by Achoris, independent monarch of Egypt, and Hecatomnus,
vassal king of Caria, he was able to take the offensive, to conquer
Tyre, and extend his revolt into Cilicia and Idumaea. An expedition
undertaken against him by Autophradates, satrap of Lydia, seems to have
failed. It was the first object of the Persians, after concluding the
"Peace of Antalcidas," to crush Evagoras. They collected 300 vessels,
partly from the Greeks of Asia, and brought together an army of 300,000
men. The fleet of Evagoras numbered 200 triremes, and with these he
ventured on an attack, but was completely defeated by Tiribazus, who
shut him up in Salamis, and, after a struggle which continued for at
least six years, compelled him to submit to terms (B.C. 380 or 379).
More fortunate than former rebels, he obtained not merely a promise of
pardon, which would probably have been violated, but a recognition of
his title, and permission to remain in his government, with the single
obligation of furnishing to the Great King a certain annual tribute.
</p>
<p>
During the continuance of this war, Artaxerxes was personally engaged in
military operations in another part of his dominions. The Cadusians,
who inhabited the low and fertile tract between the Elburz range and the
Caspian, having revolted against his authority, Artaxerxes invaded their
territory at the head of an army which is estimated at 300,000 foot and
10,000 horse. The land was little cultivated, rugged, and covered with
constant fogs; the men were brave and warlike, and having admitted him
into their country, seem to have waylaid and intercepted his convoys.
His army was soon reduced to great straits, and forced to subsist on the
cavalry horses and the baggage-animals. A most disastrous result must
have followed, had not Tiribazus, who had been recalled from Cyprus
on charges preferred against him by the commander of the land force,
Orontes, contrived very artfully to induce the rebels to make their
submission. Artaxerxes was thus enabled to withdraw from the country
without serious disaster, having shown in his short campaign that he
possessed the qualities of a soldier, but was entirely deficient in
those of a general.
</p>
<p>
A time of comparative tranquillity seems to have followed the Cadusian
campaign. Artaxerxes strengthened his hold upon the Asiatic Greeks by
razing some of their towns and placing garrisons in others. His satraps
even ventured to commence the absorption of the islands off the coast;
and there is evidence that Sanaos, at any rate, was reduced and added
to the Empire. Cilicia, Phoenicia, and Idumaea were doubtless recovered
soon after the great defeat of Evagoras. There remained only one
province in this quarter which still maintained its revolt, and enjoyed,
under native monarchs, the advantages of independence. This was Egypt,
which had now continued free for above thirty years, since it shook off
the yoke of Darius Nothus. Artaxerxes, anxious to recover this portion
of his ancestral dominions, applied in B.C. 375 to Athens for the
services of her great general, Iphicrates. His request was granted, and
in the next year a vast armament was assembled at Acre under Iphicrates
and Pharnabazus, which effected a successful landing in the Delta at the
Mendesian mouth of the Nile, stormed the town commanding this branch of
the river, and might have taken Memphis, could the energetic advice of
the Athenian have stirred to action the sluggish temper of his Persian
colleague. But Pharnabazus declined to be hurried, and preferred to
proceed leisurely and according to rule. The result was that the season
for hostilities passed and nothing had been done. The Nile rose as the
summer drew on, and flooded most of the Delta; the expedition could
effect nothing, and had to return. Pharnabazus and Iphicrates parted
amid mutual recriminations; and the reduction of Egypt was deferred for
above a quarter of a century.
</p>
<p>
In Greece, however, the Great King still retained that position of
supreme arbiter with which he had been invested at the "Peace of
Antalcidas." In B.C. 372 Antalcidas was sent by Sparta a second time up
to Susa, for the purpose of obtaining an imperial rescript, prescribing
the terms on which the then existing hostilities among the Greeks should
cease. In B.C. 367 Pelopidas and Ismenias proceeded with the same object
from Thebes to the Persian capital. In the following year a rescript,
more in their favor than former ones, was obtained by Athens. Thus every
one of the leading powers of Greece applied in turn to the Great King
for his royal mandate, so erecting him by common consent into a sort of
superior, whose decision was to be final in all cases of Greek quarrel.
</p>
<p>
But this external acknowledgment of the imperial greatness of Persia
did not, and could not, check the internal decay and tendency to
disintegration, which was gradually gaining head, and threatening the
speedy dissolution of the Empire. The long reign of Artaxerxes Mnemon
was now verging towards its close. He was advanced in years, and
enfeebled in mind and body, suspicious of his sons and of his nobles,
especially of such as showed more than common ability. Under these
circumstances, revolts on the part of satraps grew frequent. First
Ariobarzanes, satrap of Phrygia, renounced his allegiance (B.C. 366),
and defended himself with success against Autophradates, satrap of
Lydia, and Mausolus, native king of Caria under Persia, to whom the
task of reducing him had been entrusted. Then Aspis, who held a part
of Cappadocia, revolted and maintained himself by the help of the
Pisidians, until he was overpowered by Datames. Next Datames himself,
satrap of the rest of Cappadocia, understanding that Artaxerxes' mind
was poisoned against him, made a treaty with Ariobarzanes, and assumed
an independent attitude in his own province. In this position he
resisted all the efforts of Autophradates to reduce him to obedience;
and Artaxerxes condescended first to make terms with him and then to
remove him by treachery. Finally (B.C. 362), there seems to have been
something like a general revolt of the western provinces, in which the
satraps of Mysia, Phrygia, and Lydia, Mausolus, prince of Caria, and the
people of Lycia, Pamphylia, Cilicia, Syria, and Phoenicia participated.
Tachos, king of Egypt, fomented the disturbances, which were also
secretly encouraged by the Spartans. A terrible conflict appeared to be
imminent; but it was avoided by the ordinary resources of bribery and
treachery. Orontes, satrap of Phrygia, and Rheomithras, one of the
revolted generals, yielding to the attractions of Persian gold, deserted
and betrayed their confederates. The insurrection was in this way
quelled, but it had raised hopes in Egypt, which did not at once
subside. Tachos, the native king, having secured the services of
Agesilaus as general, and of Chabrias, the Athenian, as admiral of his
fleet, boldly advanced into Syria, was well received by the Phoenicians,
and commenced the siege of some of the Syrian cities. Persia might
have suffered considerable loss in this quarter, had not the internal
quarrels of the Egyptians among themselves proved a better protection to
her than her own armies. Two pretenders to the throne sprang up as soon
as Tachos had quitted the country, and he was compelled to return to
Egypt in order to resist them. The force intended to strike a vigorous
blow against the power of Artaxerxes was dissipated in civil conflicts;
and Persia had once more to congratulate herself on the intestine
divisions of her adversaries. A few years after this, Artaxerxes died,
having reigned forty-six years, and lived, if we may trust Plutarch,
ninety-four. Like most of the later Persian kings, he was unfortunate
in his domestic relations. To his original queen, Statira, he was indeed
fondly attached; and she appears to have merited and returned his love,
but in all other respects his private life was unhappy. Its chief curse
was Parysatis, the queen-mother. This monster of cruelty held Artaxerxes
in a species of bondage during almost the whole of his long reign, and
acted as if she were the real sovereign of the country. She encouraged
Cyrus in his treason, and brought to most horrible ends all those who
had been prominent in frustrating it. She poisoned Statira out of hatred
and jealousy, because she had a certain degree of influence over her
husband. She encouraged Artaxerxes to contract an incestuous marriage
with his daughter Atossa, a marriage which proved a fertile source
of further calamities. Artaxerxes had three sons by Statira&mdash;Darius,
Ariaspes, and Ochus. Of these Darius, as the eldest, was formally
declared the heir. But Ochus, ambitious of reigning, intrigued with
Atossa, and sought to obtain the succession by her aid. So good seemed
to Darius the chances of his brother's success that he took the rash
step of conspiring against the life of his father, as the only way of
securing the throne. His conspiracy was detected, and he was seized and
executed, Ariaspes thereby becoming the eldest son, and so the natural
heir. Ochus then persuaded Ariaspes that he had offended his father,
and was about to be put to a cruel and ignominious death, whereupon that
prince in despair committed suicide. His elder brothers thus removed,
there still remained one rival, whom Ochus feared. This was Arsames, one
of his half-brothers, an illegitimate son of Artaxerxes, who stood high
in his favor. Assassination was the weapon employed to get rid of this
rival. It is said that this last blow was too much for the aged and
unhappy king, who died of grief on receiving intelligence of the murder.
</p>
<p>
Artaxerxes was about the weakest of all the Persian monarchs. He was
mild in temperament, affable in demeanor, goodnatured, affectionate
and well-meaning. But, possessing no strength of will, he allowed the
commission of the most atrocious acts, the most horrible cruelties, by
those about him, who were bolder and more resolute than himself. The
wife and son, whom he fondly loved, were plotted against before his
eyes; and he had neither the skill to prevent nor the courage to avenge
their fate. Incapable of resisting entreaty and importunity, he granted
boons which he ought to have refused, and condoned offences which it
would have been proper to punish. He could not maintain long the most
just resentment, but remitted punishments even when they were far milder
than the crime deserved. He was fairly successful in the management
of his relations with foreign countries, and in the suppression of
disturbances within his own dominions; but he was quite incapable
of anything like a strenuous and prolonged effort to renovate and
re-invigorate the Empire. If he held together the territories which he
inherited, and bequeathed them to his successor augmented rather than
diminished, it is to be attributed more to his good fortune than to his
merits, and to the mistakes of his opponents than to his own prudence or
sagacity.
</p>
<p>
Ochus, who obtained the crown in the manner related above, was the most
cruel and sanguinary of all the Persian kings. He is indeed the only
monarch of the Achaemenian line who appears to have been bloodthirsty
by temperament. His first act on finding himself acknowledged king (B.C.
359) was to destroy, so far as he could, all the princes of the blood
royal, in order that he might have no rival to fear. He even, if we may
believe Justin, involved in this destruction a number of the princesses,
whom any but the most ruthless of despots would have spared. Having
taken these measures for his own security, he proceeded to show himself
more active and enterprising than any monarch since Longimanus. It was
now nearly half a century since one of the important provinces of the
Empire&mdash;Egypt&mdash;had successfully asserted its independence and restored
the throne of its native kings. General after general had been employed
in vain attempts to reduce the rebels to obedience. Ochus determined
to attempt the recovery of the revolted province in person. Though
a rebellion had broken out in Asia Minor, which being supported by
Thebes, threatened to become serious, he declined to be diverted from
his enterprise. Levying a vast army, he marched into Egypt, and engaged
Noctanebo, the king, in a contest for existence. Nectanebo, however,
having obtained the services of two Greek generals, Diophantus, an
Athenian, and Lamius, a citizen of Sparta, boldly met his enemy in the
field, defeated him, and completely repulsed his expedition. Hereupon
the contagion of revolt spread. Phoenicia assumed independence under the
leadership of Sidon, expelled or massacred the Persian garrisons, which
held her cities, and formed an alliance with Egypt. Her example was
followed by Cyprus, where the kings of the nine principal towns assumed
each a separate sovereignty.
</p>
<p>
The chronology of this period is somewhat involved; but it seems
probable that the attack and failure of Ochus took place about B.C. 351;
that the revolts occurred in the next year, B.C. 350; while it was not
till B.C. 346, or four years later, that Ochus undertook his second
expedition into these regions. He had, however, in the meanwhile,
directed his generals or feudatories, to attack the rebels, and bring
them into subjection. The Cyprian war he had committed to Idrieus,
prince of Caria, who employed on the service a body of 8000 Greek
mercenaries, commanded by Phocion, the Athenian, and Evagoras, son of
the former Evagoras, the Cyprian monarch; while he had committed to
Belesys, satrap of Syria, and Mezseus, satrap of Cilicia, the task of
keeping the Phoenicians in check. Idrieus succeeded in reducing Cyprus;
but the two satraps suffered a single defeat at the hands of Tennes, the
Sidonian king, who was aided by 40,000 Greek mercenaries, sent him by
Nectanebo, and commanded by Mentor the Rhodian. The Persian forces were
driven out of Phoenicia; and Sidon had ample time to strengthen its
defences and make preparations for a desperate resistance. The approach,
however, of Ochus, at the head of an army of 330,000 men, shook the
resolution of the Phoenician monarch, who endeavored to purchase his
own pardon by treacherously delivering up a hundred of the principal
citizens of Sidon into the hands of the Persian king, and then admitting
him within the defences of the town. Ochus, with the savage cruelty
which was his chief characteristic, caused the hundred citizens to be
transfixed with javelins, and when 500 more came out as suppliants to
entreat his mercy, relentlessly consigned them to the same fate. Nor did
the traitor Tennes derive any advantage from his guilty bargain.
Ochus, having obtained from him all he needed, instead of rewarding his
desertion, punished his rebellion with death. Hereupon the Sidonians,
understanding that they had nothing to hope from submission, formed the
dreadful resolution of destroying themselves and their town. They had
previously, to prevent the desertion of any of their number, burnt their
ships. Now they shut themselves up in their houses, and set fire each
to his own dwelling. Forty thousand persons lost their lives in the
conflagration; and the city was reduced to a heap of ruins, which Ochus
sold for a large sum. Thus ended the Phoenician revolt. Among its most
important results was the transfer of his services to the Persian king
on the part of Mentor the Rhodian, who appears to have been the ablest
of the mercenary leaders of whom Greece at this time produced so many.
</p>
<p>
The reduction of Sidon was followed closely by the invasion of
Egypt. Ochus, besides his 330,000 Asiatics, had now a force of 14,000
Greeks&mdash;6000 furnished by the Greek cities of Asia Minor; 4000 under
Mentor, consisting of the troops which he had brought to the aid of
Tennes from Egypt; 3000 sent by Argos; and 1000 from Thebes. He divided
his numerous armament into three bodies, and placed at the head of
each two generals&mdash;one Persian and one Greek. The Greek commanders were
Lacrates of Thebes, Mentor of Rhodes, and Nicostratus of Argos, a man
of enormous strength, who regarded himself as a second Hercules, and
adopted the traditional costume of that hero&mdash;a club and a lion's skin.
The Persians were Rhossaces, Aristazanes, and Bagoas, the chief of the
eunuchs. Nectanebo was only able to oppose to this vast array an army
less than one third of the size. Twenty thousand, however, out of the
100,000 troops at his disposal were Greeks; he occupied the Nile and
its various branches with a numerous navy the character of the country,
intersected by numerous canals, and full of strongly fortified towns,
was in his favor; and he might have been expected to make a prolonged,
if not even a successful, resistance. But he was deficient in generals,
and over-confident in his own powers of command: the Greek captains
out-manoeuvred him; and no sooner did he find one line of his defences
forced than his ill-founded confidence was exchanged for an alarm
as little reasonable. He hastily fell back upon Memphis, leaving the
fortified towns to the defence of their garrisons. These consisted of
mixed troops, partly Greek and partly Egyptian; between whom jealousies
and suspicions were easily sown by the Persian leaders, who by these
means rapidly reduced the secondary cities of Lower Egypt, and were
advancing upon Memphis, when Nectanebo in despair quitted the country
and fled southwards to Ethiopia. All Egypt submitted to Ochus, who
demolished the walls of the cities, plundered the temples, and after
amply rewarding his mercenaries, returned to his own capital with an
immense booty, and with the glory of having successfully carried through
a most difficult and important enterprise.
</p>
<p>
It has been well observed that "the reconquest of Egypt by Ochus must
have been one of the most impressive events of the age," and that it
"exalted the Persian Empire in force and credit to a point nearly as
high as it had ever occupied before." Ochus not only redeemed by means
of it his former failure, but elevated himself in the opinions of men to
a pitch of glory such as no previous Persian king had reached, excepting
Cyrus, Cambyses, and the first Darius. Henceforth we hear of no more
revolts or rebellions. Mentor and Bagoas, the two generals who had most
distinguished themselves in the Egyptian campaign, were advanced by the
gratitude of Ochus to posts of the highest importance, in which their
vigor and energy found ample room to display themselves. Mentor, who was
governor of the entire Asiatic sea-board, exerted himself successfully
to reduce to subjection the many chiefs who during the recent troubles
had assumed an independent authority, and in the course of a few
years brought once more the whole coast into complete submission and
dependence. Bagoas, carried with him by Ochus to the capital, became
the soul of the internal administration, and maintained tranquillity
throughout the rest of the Empire. The last six years of the reign of
Ochus form an exceptional period of vigorous and successful government,
such as occurs nowhere else in the history of the later Persian
monarchy. The credit of bringing about such a state of things may be due
especially to the king's officers, Bagoas and Mentor; but a portion of
it must reflect upon himself, as the person who selected them, assigned
them their respective tasks, and permanently maintained them in office.
</p>
<p>
It was during this period of vigor and renewed life, when the Persian
monarchy seemed to have recovered almost its pristine force and
strength, that the attention of its rulers was called to a small cloud
on the distant horizon, which some were wise enough to see portended
storm and tempest. The growing power of Macedon, against which
Demosthenes was at this time in vain warning the careless Athenians,
attracted the consideration of Ochus or of his counsellors; and orders
went forth from the Court that Persian influence was to be used to check
and depress the rising kingdom. A force was consequently despatched to
assist the Thracian prince, Cersobleptes, to maintain his independence;
and such effectual aid was given to the city of Perinthus that the
numerous and well-appointed army with which Philip had commenced its
siege was completely baffled and compelled to give up the attempt (B.C.
340). The battle of Chseroneia had not yet been fought, and Macedonia
was still but one of the many states which disputed for supremacy over
Greece; but it is evident that she had already awakened the suspicions
of Persia, which saw a rival and a possible assailant in the rapidly
growing monarchy.
</p>
<p>
Greater and more systematic efforts might possibly have been made, and
the power of Macedon might perhaps have been kept within bounds, had not
the inveterate evil of conspiracy and revolution once more shown itself
at the Court, and paralyzed for a time the action of the Empire on
communities beyond its borders. Ochus, while he was a vigorous ruler
and administrator, was harsh and sanguinary. His violence and cruelty
rendered him hateful to his subjects; and it is not unlikely that they
caused even those who stood highest in his favor to feel insecure.
Bagoas may have feared that sooner or later he would himself be one
of the monarch's victims, and have been induced by a genuine alarm
to remove the source of his terrors. In the year B.C. 338 he poisoned
Ochus, and placed upon the throne his youngest son, Arses, at the same
time assassinating all the brothers of the new monarch. It was evidently
his aim to exercise the supreme power himself, as counsellor to a prince
who owed his position to him, and who was moreover little more than a
boy. But Arses, though subservient for a year or two, began, as he grew
older, to show that he had a will of his own, and was even heard to
utter threats against his benefactor whereupon Bagoas, accustomed now to
crime, secured himself by a fresh series of murders. He caused Arses and
his infant children to be assassinated, and selected one of his friends,
Codomannus, the son of Arsanes, to fill the vacant throne. About the
same time (B.C. 336), Philip of Macedon was assassinated by the incensed
Pausanias; and the two new monarchs&mdash;Codomannus, who took the name
of Darius, and Alexander the Great&mdash;assumed their respective sceptres
almost simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
Codomannus, the last of the Persian kings, might with some reason have
complained, like Plato, that nature had brought him in the world too
late. Personally brave, as he proved himself into the Cadusian war,
tall and strikingly handsome, amiable in temper, capable of considerable
exertion, and not altogether devoid of military capacity, he would have
been a fairly good ruler in ordinary times, and might, had he fallen
upon such times, have held an honorable place among the Persian
monarchs. But he was unequal to the difficulties of such a position as
that in which he found himself. Raised to the throne after the victory
of Chaeroneia had placed Philip at the head of Greece, and when a
portion of the Macedonian forces had already passed into Asia, he was
called upon to grapple at once with a danger of the most formidable
kind, and had but little time for preparation. It is true that Philip's
death soon after his own accession gave him a short breathing-space:
but at the same time it threw him off his guard. The military talents of
Alexander were untried, and of course unknown; the perils which he had
to encounter were patent. Codomannus may be excused if for some months
after Alexander's accession he slackened his preparations for defence,
uncertain whether the new monarch would maintain himself, whether
he would overpower the combinations which were formed against him in
Greece, whether he would inherit his father's genius for war, or adopt
his ambitious projects. It would have been wiser, no doubt, as the event
proved, to have joined heart and soul with Alexander's European enemies,
and to have carried the war at once to the other side of the Egean. But
no great blame attaches to the Persian monarch for his brief inaction.
As soon as the Macedonian prince had shown by his campaigns in Thrace,
Illyria, and Boeotia that he was a person to be dreaded, Darius
Codomannus renewed the preparations which he had discontinued, and
pushed them forward with all the speed that was possible. A fleet was
rapidly got ready: the satraps of Asia Minor were reinforced with troops
of good quality from the interior of the Empire, and were ordered to
raise a strong force of mercenaries; money was sent into Greece to the
Lacedaemonians and others in order to induce them to create disturbances
in Europe; above all, Memnon the Rhodian, a brother of Mentor, and a
commander of approved skill, was sent to the Hellespont, at the head of
a body of Greeks in Persian pay, with an authority co-ordinate to that
of the satraps.
</p>
<p>
A certain amount of success at first attended these measures. Memnon
was able to act on the offensive in North-Western Asia. He marched upon
Cyzicus and was within a little of surprising it, obtaining from the
lands and villas without the walls an immense booty. He forced Parmenio
to raise the seige of Pitane; and when Callas, one of the Macedonian
leaders, endeavored to improve the condition of things by meeting the
Persian forces in the open field, he suffered a defeat and was compelled
to throw himself into Rhoeteum.
</p>
<p>
These advantages, however, were detrimental rather than serviceable to
the Persian cause; since they encouraged the Persian satraps to regard
the Macedonians as an enemy no more formidable than the various tribes
of Greeks with whom they had now carried on war in Asia Minor for
considerably more than a century. The intended invasion of Alexander
seemed to them a matter of no great moment&mdash;to be classed with
expeditions like those of Thimbron and Agesilaus, not to need, as it
really did, to be placed in a category of its own. Accordingly, they
made no efforts to dispute the passage of the Hellespont, or to oppose
the landing of the expedition on the Asiatic shore. Alexander was
allowed to transport a force of 30,000 foot and 4000 or 5000 horse from
the Chersonese to Mysia without the slightest interference on the part
of the enemy, notwithstanding that his naval power was weak and that
of the Persians very considerable. This is one of those pieces of
remissness in the Persian conduct of military matters, whereof we have
already had to note signal instances, and which constantly caused the
failure of very elaborate and judicious preparations to meet a danger.
Great efforts had been made to collect and equip a numerous fleet, and
a few weeks later it was all-powerful in the Egean. But it was absent
exactly at the time when it was wanted. Alexander's passage and landing
were unopposed, and the Persians thus admitted within the Empire without
a struggle the enemy who was fated to destroy it.
</p>
<p>
When the Persian commanders heard that Alexander was in Asia, they
were anxious to give him battle. One alone, the Rhodian Greek, Memnon,
proposed and urged a wholly different plan of operations. Memnon advised
that a general engagement should be avoided, that the entire country
should be laid waste, and even the cities burnt, while the army
should retire, cut off stragglers, and seek to bring the enemy into
difficulties. At the same time he recommended that the fleet should be
brought up, a strong land force embarked on board it, and an effort made
to transfer the war into Europe. But Memnon's colleagues, the satraps
and commandants of the north-western portion of Asia Minor, could not
bring themselves to see that circumstances required a line of action
which they regarded as ignominious. It is not necessary to attribute to
them personal or selfish motives. They probably thought honestly that
they were a match for Alexander with the troops at their disposal, and
viewed retreat before an enemy numerically weaker than themselves as
a disgrace not to be endured unless its necessity was palpable.
Accordingly they determined to give the invader battle. Supposing that
Alexander, having crossed into Asia at Abydos, would proceed to attack
Dascyleium, the nearest satrapial capital, they took post on the
Granicus, and prepared to dispute the further advance of the Macedonian
army. They had collected a force of 20,000 cavalry of the best quality
that the Empire afforded, and nearly the same number of infantry,
who were chiefly, if not solely, Greek mercenaries. With these
they determined to defend the passage of the small stream above
mentioned&mdash;one of the many which flow from the northern flank of Ida
into the Propontis.
</p>
<p>
The battle thus offered was eagerly accepted by the Macedonian. If he
could not defeat with ease a Persian force not greatly exceeding his
own, he had miscalculated the relative goodness of the soldiers on
either side, and might as well desist from the expedition. Accordingly,
he no sooner came to the bank of the river, and saw the enemy drawn up
on the other side, than, rejecting the advice of Parmenio to wait till
the next day, he gave orders that the whole army should enter the stream
and advance across it. The Granicus was in most places fordable; but
there were occasional deeper parts, which had to be avoided; and there
was thus some difficulty in reaching the opposite bank in line. That
bank itself was generally steep and precipitous, but offered also
several gentle slopes where a landing was comparatively easy. The
Persians had drawn up their cavalry along the line of the river close to
the water's edge, and had placed their infantry in the rear. Alexander
consequently attacked with his cavalry. The engagement began upon the
right. Amytas and Ptolemy, who were the first to reach the opposite
bank, met with a strenuous resistance and were driven back into the
stream by the forces of Memnon and his sons. The battle, however, on
this side was restored by Alexander himself, who gradually forced the
Persians back after a long hand-to-hand fight, in which he received
a slight wound, and slew with his own hand several noble Persians.
Elsewhere the resistance was less determined. Parmenio crossed on the
left with comparative ease, by his advance relieving Alexander. The
Persians found the long spears of the Macedonians and their intermixture
of light-armed foot with heavy-armed cavalry irresistible. The
Macedonians seem to have received orders to strike at their adversaries'
faces&mdash;a style of warfare which was as unpleasant to the Persians as it
was to the soldiers of Pompey at Pharsalia. Their line was broken
where it was opposed to Alexander and his immediate companions; but the
contagion of disorder rapidly spread, and the whole body of the cavalry
shortly quitted the field, after having lost a thousand of their number.
Only the infantry now remained. Against these the Macedonian phalanx was
brought up in front, while the cavalry made repeated charges on
either flank with overwhelming effect. Deserted by their horse, vastly
outnumbered, and attacked on all sides, the brave mercenaries stood
firm, fought with desperation, and were mostly slaughtered where they
stood. Two thousand out of the 20,000&mdash;probably wounded men&mdash;were made
prisoners. The rest perished, except a few who lay concealed among the
heaps of slain.
</p>
<p>
The Persians lost by the battle 20,000 of their best footmen, and one or
two thousand horse. Among their slain the proportion of men of rank
was unusually large. The list included Spithridates, satrap of Lydia,
Mithrobarzanes, governor of Cappadocia, Pharnaces, a brother-in-law, and
Mithridates, a son-in-law of Darius, Arbupales, a grandson of Artaxerxes
Mnemon, Omares, the commander of the mercenaries, Niphates, Petines,
and Ehoesaces, generals. The Greek loss is said to have been exceedingly
small. Aristobulus made the total number of the slain thirty-four;
Arrian gives it as one hundred and fifteen, or a little over. It has
been suspected that even the latter estimate is below the truth; but the
analogy furnished by the other great victories of the Greeks over the
Persians tends rather to confirm Arrian's statement.
</p>
<p>
The battle of the Granicus threw open to Alexander the whole of Asia
Minor. There was no force left in the entire country that could venture
to resist him, unless protected by walls. Accordingly, the Macedonian
operations for the next twelve months, or during nearly the whole
space that intervened between the battles of the Granicus and of Issus,
consist of little more than a series of marches and sieges. The reader
of Persian history will scarcely wish for an account of these operations
in detail. Suffice it to say that Alexander rapidly overran Lydia,
Ionia, Caria, Lycia, Pamphylia, Pisidia, and Phrygia, besieged and took
Miletus, Halicarnassus, Marmareis, and Sagalassus, and received the
submission of Dascyleium, Sardis, Ephesus, Magnesia, Tralles, the Lycian
Telmisseis, Pinara, Xanthus, Patara, Phaselis, Side, Aspendus, Celaenee,
and Gordium. This last city was the capital of Phrygia; and there the
conqueror for the first time since his landing gave himself and his army
a few months' rest during the latter part of the winter.
</p>
<p>
With the first breath of spring his forces were again in motion.
Hitherto anxious with respect to the state of things on the coast and in
Greece, he had remained in the western half of Asia Minor, within call
of his friends in Macedonia, at no time distant more than about 200
miles from the sea. Now intelligence reached him which made him feel at
liberty to advance into the interior of Asia. Memnon the Rhodian fell
sick and died in the early spring of B.C. 333. It is strange that so
much should have depended on a single life; but it certainly seems that
there was no one in the Persian service who, on Memnon's death, could
replace him&mdash;no one fitted for the difficult task of uniting Greeks and
Asiatics together, capable of influencing and managing the one while he
preserved the confidence of the other. Memnon's death disconcerted all
the plans of the Great King, who till it occurred had fully intended to
carry the war into his enemy's country. It induced Darius even to give
up the notion of maintaining a powerful fleet, and to transfer to the
land service the most efficient of his naval forces. At the same time it
set Alexander free to march wherever he liked, liberating him from the
keen anxiety, which he had previously felt, as to the maintenance of the
Macedonian power in Europe.
</p>
<p>
It now became the object of the Persian king to confront the daring
invader of his Western provinces with an army worthy of the Persian
name and proportionate to the vastness of the Empire. He had long been
collecting troops from many of the most warlike nations, and had got
together a force of several hundred thousand men. Forgetting the lessons
of his country's previous history, he flattered himself that the host
which he had brought together was irresistible, and became anxious to
hurry on a general engagement. Starting from Babylon, probably about the
time that Alexander left Gordium in Phrygia, he marched up the valley of
the Euphrates, and took up a position at Sochi, which was situated in
a large open plain, not far from the modern Lake of Antioch. On his
arrival there he heard that Alexander was in Cilicia at no great
distance; and the Greeks in his service assured him that it would not
be long before the Macedonian monarch would seek him out and accept his
offer of battle. But a severe attack of illness detained Alexander at
Tarsus, and when he was a little recovered, troubles in Western Cilicia,
threatening his communications with Greece, required his presence;
so that Darius grew impatient, and, believing that his enemy had no
intention of advancing further than Cilicia, resolved to seek him in
that country. Quitting the open plain of Sochi, he marched northwards,
having the range of Amanus on his left, almost as far as the
thirty-seventh parallel, when turning sharply to the west, he crossed
the chain, and descended upon Issus, in the inner recess of the gulf
which bore the same name. Here he came upon Alexander's hospitals, and
found himself to his surprise in the rear of his adversary, who, while
Darius was proceeding northwards along the eastern flank of Amanus, had
been marching southwards between the western flank of the same range and
the sea. Alexander had crossed the Pylse, or narrowest portion of the
pass, and had reached Myriandrus&mdash;a little beyond Iskonderum&mdash;when news
reached him that Darius had occupied Issus in his rear, and had put
to death all the sick and wounded Macedonians whom he had found in the
town. At first he could not credit the intelligence; but when it was
confirmed by scouts, whom he sent out, he prepared instantly to retrace
his steps, and to fight his first great battle with the Persian king
under circumstances which he felt to be favorable beyond anything that
he could have hoped. The tract of flat land between the base of the
mountains and the sea on the borders of the Gulf of Issus was nowhere
broader than about a mile and a half. The range of Amanus on the
east rose up with rugged and broken hills, so that on this side the
operations of cavalry were impracticable. It would be impossible to
form a line of battle containing in the front rank more than about 4000
men,1048 and difficult for either party to bring into action as many as
30,000 of their soldiers. Thus the vast superiority of numbers on the
Persian side became in such a position absolutely useless, and even
Alexander had more troops than he could well employ. No wonder that the
Macedonian should exclaim, that "God had declared Himself on the Grecian
side by putting it into the heart of Darius to execute such a movement."
It may be that Alexander's superior generalship would have made him
victorious even on the open plain of Sochi; but in the defile of Issus
success was certain, and generalship superfluous.
</p>
<p>
Darius had started from Issus in pursuit of his adversary, and had
reached the banks of the Pinarus, a small stream flowing westward from
Amanus into the Mediterranean, when he heard that Alexander had hastened
to retrace his stops, and was coming to meet him. Immediately he
prepared for battle. Passing a force of horse and foot across the stream
in his front, to keep his adversary in check if he advanced too rapidly,
he drew up his best troops along the line of the river in a continuous
solid mass, the ranks of which must have been at least twenty deep.
Thirty thousand Greek mercenaries formed the centre of the line, while
on either side of them were an equal number of Asiatic "braves"&mdash;picked
probably from the mass of the army. Twenty thousand troops of a lighter
and inferior class were placed upon the rough hills on the left, the
outskirts of the Amanian range, where the nature of the ground allowed
them to encircle the Macedonian right, which, to preserve its ranks
unbroken, kept the plain. The cavalry, to the number of 30,000, was
massed upon the other wing, near the sea.
</p>
<p>
The battle began by certain movements of Alexander against the flank
force which menaced his right. These troops, assailed by the Macedonian
light-armed, retreated at once to higher ground, and by their manifest
cowardice freed Alexander from all anxiety on their account. Leaving 300
horse to keep the 20,000 in check, he moved on his whole line at a slow
pace towards the Pinarus till it came within bow-shot of the enemy, when
he gave the order to proceed at a run. The line advanced as commanded;
but before it could reach the river, the Persian horse on the extreme
right, unable to restrain themselves any longer, dashed across the
shallow stream, and assailed Alexander's left, where they engaged in a
fierce battle with the Thessalian cavalry, in which neither attained any
decided advantage. The infantry, meanwhile, came into conflict along
the rest of the line. Alexander himself, with the right and the
right-centre, charged the Asiatic troops on Darius's left, who, like
their brethren at Cunaxa, instantly broke and fled. Parmenio, with the
left-centre, was less successful. The north bank of the Pinarus was in
this part steep and defended by stakes in places; the Greek mercenaries
were as brave as the Macedonians, and fought valiantly. It was not till
the troops which had routed the Persian right began, to act against
their centre, assailing it upon the flank, while it was at the same time
engaged in front, that the mercenaries were overpowered and gave way.
Seeing their defeat, the horse likewise fled, and thus the rout became
general.
</p>
<p>
It is not quite clear what part Darius took in the battle, or how far
he was answerable for its untoward result. According to Arrian, he was
struck with a sudden panic on beholding the flight of his left wing, and
gave orders to his charioteer instantly to quit the field. But Curtius
and Diodorus represent him as engaged in a long struggle against
Alexander himself, and as only flying when he was in imminent danger of
falling into the enemy's hands. Justin goes further, and states that
he was actually wounded. The character gained by Darius in his earlier
years makes it improbable that he would under any circumstances have
exhibited personal cowardice. On the whole it would seem to be most
probable that the flight of the Persian monarch occurred, not when the
left wing fled, but when the Greek mercenaries among whom he had placed
himself began to give way before the irresistible phalanx and the
impetuous charges of Alexander. Darius, not unwisely, accepted the
defeat of his best troops as the loss of the battle, and hastily retired
across Amanus by the pass which had brought him to Issus, whence
he hurried on through Sochi to the Euphrates, anxious to place that
obstacle between himself and his victorious enemy. His multitudinous
host, entangled in the defiles of the mountains, suffered by its own
weight and size, the stronger fugitives treading down the weaker, while
at the same time it was ruthlessly slaughtered by the pursuing enemy,
so long as the waning light allowed. As many as 100,000&mdash;90,000 foot and
10,000 horse&mdash;are said to have fallen. The ravines were in places choked
with the dead bodies, and Ptolemy the son of Lagus related that in one
instance he and Alexander crossed a gully on a bridge of this kind.
Among the slain were Sabaces, satrap of Egypt, Bubaces, a noble of high
rank, and Arsames, Rheomithres, and Atizyes, three of the commanders
at the Granicus. Forty thousand prisoners were made. The whole of the
Persian camp and camp-equipage fell into the enemy's hands, who found in
the royal pavilion the mother, wife, and sister of the king, an
infant son, two daughters, and a number of female attendants, wives of
noblemen. The treasure captured amounted to 3000 silver talents. Among
the trophies of victory were the chariot, bow, shield, and robe of the
king, which he had abandoned in his hurried flight.
</p>
<p>
The loss on the side of the Macedonians was trivial. The highest
estimate places it at 450 killed, the lowest at 182. Besides these,
504 were wounded. Thus Alexander had less than 1000 men placed hors de
combat. He himself received a slight wound in the thigh from a sword,
which, used a little more resolutely, might have changed the fortunes of
the world.
</p>
<p>
The defeat of the Persians at Issus seems to have been due simply to the
fact that, practically, the two adversaries engaged with almost equal
numbers, and that the troops of Alexander were of vastly superior
quality to those of Darhis. The Asiatic infantry&mdash;notwithstanding their
proud title of "braves"&mdash;proved to be worthless; the Greek mercenaries
were personally courageous, but their inferior arms and training
rendered them incapable of coping with the Macedonian phalanx. The
cavalry was the only arm in which the Persians were not greatly at a
disadvantage; and cavalry alone cannot gain, or even save a battle.
When Darius put himself into a position where he lost all the advantages
derivable from superiority of numbers, he made his own defeat and his
adversary's triumph certain.
</p>
<p>
It remained, therefore, before the Empire could be considered as
entirely lost, that this error should be corrected, this false step
retrieved. All hope for Persia was not gone, so long as her full force
had not been met and defeated in a fair and open field. When Darius fled
from Issus, it was not simply to preserve for a few months longer his
own wretched life; it was to make an effort to redeem the past&mdash;to give
his country that last chance of maintaining her independence which she
had a right to claim at his hands&mdash;to try what the award of battle
would be under the circumstances which he had fair grounds for
regarding as the most favorable possible to his own side and the most
disadvantageous to his adversary. Before the heart of the Empire
could be reached from the West, the wide Mesopotamian plain had to be
traversed&mdash;there, in those vast flats, across which the enemy must come,
a position might be chosen where there would be room for the largest
numbers that even his enormous Empire could furnish&mdash;where cavalry and
even chariots would be everywhere free to act&mdash;where consequently he
might engage the puny force of his antagonist to the greatest advantage,
outflank it, envelop it, and perhaps destroy it. Darius would have
been inexcusable had he given up the contest without trying this last
chance&mdash;the chance of a battle in the open field with the full collected
force of Persia.
</p>
<p>
His adversary gave him ample time to prepare for this final struggle.
The battle of Issus was fought in November, B.C. 333. It was not till
the summer of B.C. 331, twenty months later that the Macedonian forces
were set in motion towards the interior of the Empire. More than a year
and a half was consumed in the reduction of Phoenicia, the siege of
Gaza, and the occupation of Egypt. Alexander, apparently, was confident
of defeating Darius in a pitched battle, whenever and under whatever
circumstances they should again meet; and regarded as the only
serious dangers which threatened him, a possible interruption of his
communications with Greece, and the employment of Persian gold and
Persian naval force in the raising of troubles on the European side of
the Egean. He was therefore determined, before he plunged into the depth
of the Asiatic continent, to isolate Persia from Greece, to destroy her
naval power, and to cripple her pecuniary resources. The event showed
that his decision was a wise one. By detaching from Persia and bringing
under his own sway the important countries of Syria, Phoenicia,
Palestine, Idumsea, and Egypt, he wholly deprived Persia of her navy,
and transferred to himself the complete supremacy of the sea, he greatly
increased his own resources while he diminished those of the enemy, and
he shut out Persia altogether from communication with Greece, excepting
through his territories. He could therefore commence his march into the
interior with a feeling of entire security as to his communications and
his rear. No foe was left on the coast capable of causing him a moment's
uneasiness. Athens and Sparta might chafe and even intrigue; but without
the Persian "archers," it was impossible that any force should be raised
which could in the slightest degree imperil his European dominions.
</p>
<p>
From Babylon, whither Darius proceeded straight from Issus, he appears
to have made two ineffectual attempts at negotiating with his enemy. The
first embassy was despatched soon after his arrival, and, according
to Arrian, was instructed merely to make proposals for peace, and to
request the restitution of the Queen, the Queen-mother, Sisygambis, the
infant prince, and the two princesses, captured by Alexander. To this
Alexander replied, in haughty and contemptuous terms, that if Darius
would acknowledge him as Lord of Asia, and deliver himself into his
power, he should receive back his relatives: if he intended still to
dispute the sovereignty, he ought to come and fight out the contest, and
not run away.
</p>
<p>
The second embassy was sent six or eight months later, while Alexander
was engaged in the siege of Tyre. Darius now offered, as a ransom for
the members of his family held in captivity by Alexander, the large sum
of ten thousand talents (L240,000.), and was willing to purchase peace
by the cession of all the provinces lying west of the Euphrates, several
of which were not yet in Alexander's possession. At the same time he
proposed that Alexander should marry his daughter, Statira, in order
that the cession of territory might be represented as the bestowal of a
dowry. The reply of Alexander was, if possible, ruder and haughtier than
before. "What did Darius mean by offering money and territory? All his
treasure and all his territory were Alexander's already. As for the
proposed marriage, if he (Alexander) liked to marry a daughter of
Darius, he should of course do so, whether her father consented or not.
If Darius wanted merciful treatment, he had better come and deliver
himself up at once."
</p>
<p>
The terms of this reply rendered further negotiation impossible.
Darius had probably not hoped much from his pacific overtures, and was
therefore not greatly concerned at their rejection. He knew that the
members of his family were honorably and even kindly treated by their
captor, and that, so far at any rate, Alexander had proved himself a
magnanimous conqueror. He can scarcely have thought that a lasting peace
was possible between himself and his young antagonist, who had only just
fleshed his maiden sword, and was naturally eager to pursue his career
of conquest. Indeed, he seems from the moment of his defeat at Issus to
have looked forward to another battle as inevitable, and to have been
unremitting in his efforts to collect and arm a force which might
contend, with a good hope of victory, against the Macedonians. He
replaced the panoplies lost at Issus with fresh ones; he armed his
forces anew with swords and spears longer than the Persians had been
previously accustomed to employ, on account of the great length of the
Macedonian weapons; he caused to be constructed 200 scythed chariots; he
prepared spiked balls to use against his enemy's cavalry; above all, he
laid under contribution for the supply of troops all the provinces,
even the most remote, of his extensive Empire, and asked and obtained
important aid from allies situated beyond his borders. The forces which
he collected for the final struggle comprised&mdash;besides Persians, Medes,
Babylonians, and Susianians from the centre of the Empire&mdash;Syrians from
the banks of the Orontes, Armenians from the neighborhood of Ararat,
Cappadocians and Albanians from the regions bordering on the Euxine,
Cadusians from the Caspian, Bactrians from the Upper Oxus, Sogdians from
the Jaxartes, Arachosians from Cabul, Arians from Herat, Indians from
Punjab, and even Sacse from the country about Kashgar and Yarkand, on
the borders of the Great Desert of Gobi. Twenty-five nations followed
the standard of the Great King, and swelled the ranks of his vast army,
which amounted (according to the best authorities) to above a million of
men. Every available resource that the Empire possessed was brought
into play. Besides the three arms of cavalry, infantry, and chariots,
elephants were, for perhaps the first time in the history of military
science, marshalled in the battle-field, to which they added an unwonted
element of grotesqueness and savagery.
</p>
<p>
The field of battle was likewise selected with great care, and
artificially prepared for the encounter. Darius, it would seem, had
at last become convinced that his enemy would seek him out wherever he
might happen to be, and that consequently the choice of ground rested
wholly with himself. Leaving, therefore, the direct road to Babylon
by the line of the Euphrates undefended, he selected a position which
possessed all the advantages of the Mesopotamian plain, being open,
level, fertile, and well supplied with water, while its vicinity to the
eastern and northern provinces, made it convenient for a rendezvous.
This position was on the left or east bank of the Tigris, in the heart
of the ancient Assyria, not more than thirty miles from the site of
Nineveh. Here, in the region called by the Greeks Adiabene, extended
between the Tigris and the river Zab or Lycus, a vast plain broken by
scarcely any elevations, and wholly bare of both shrubs and trees. The
few natural inequalities which presented themselves were levelled by
order of Darius, who made the entire plain in his front practicable not
only for cavalry but for chariots. At the same time he planted, in the
places where Alexander's cavalry was likely to charge, spiked balls to
damage the feet of the horses.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Alexander had quitted Egypt, and after delaying some months
in Syria while his preparations were being completed, had crossed the
Euphrates at Thapsacus and marched through northern Mesopotamia along
the southern flank of the Mons Masius, a district in which provisions,
water, and forage were abundant, to the Tigris, which he must have
reached in about lat. 36 30', thirty or forty miles above the site of
Nineveh. No resistance was made to his advance; even the passage of
the great rivers was unopposed. Arrived on the east bank of the Tigris,
Alexander found himself in Assyria Proper, with the stream upon his
right and the mountains of Gordyene Kurdistan at no great distance upon
his left. But the plain widened as he advanced, and became, as he drew
near the position of his enemy, a vast level, nowhere less than thirty
miles in breadth, between the outlying ranges of hills and the great
river. Darius, whose headquarters had been at Arbela, south of the Zab,
on learning Alexander's approach, had crossed that stream and taken post
on the prepared ground to the north, in the neighborhood of a small town
or village called Gaugamela. Here he drew up his forces in the order
which he thought best, placing the scythed chariots in front, with
supports of horse&mdash;Scythian, Bactrian, Armenian, and Cappadocian&mdash;near
to them; then, the main line of battle, divided into a centre and two
wings, and composed of horse and foot intermixed; and finally a reserve
of Babylonians. Sitaceni, and others, massed in heavy column in the
rear. His own post was, according to invariable Persian custom, in
the centre; and about him were grouped the best troops&mdash;the Household
brigade, the Melophori or Persian foot-guards, the Mardian archers, some
Albanians and Carians, the entire body of Greek mercenaries, and the
Indians with their elephants.
</p>
<p>
Alexander, on his side, determined to leave nothing to chance. Advancing
leisurely, resting his troops at intervals, carefully feeling his way by
means of scouts, and gradually learning from the prisoners whom he
took, and the deserters who came over to him, all the dispositions and
preparations of the enemy, he arrived opposite the position of Darius on
the ninth day after his passage of the Tigris. His officers were eager
to attack at once; but with great judgment he restrained them, gave his
troops a night's rest, and obtained time to reconnoitre completely the
whole position of the enemy and the arrangement which he had made of his
forces. He then formed his own dispositions. The army with which he
was to attack above a million of men consisted of 40,300 foot and 7000
horse. Alexander drew them up in three lines:
</p>
<p>
The first consisted of light-armed troops, horse and foot, of good
quality, which were especially intended to act against the enemy's
chariots. The next was the main line of battle, and contained the
phalanx with the rest of the heavy infantry in the centre, the heavy
cavalry upon the two wings. The third line consisted of light troops,
chiefly horse, and was instructed to act against such of the Persians as
should outflank the Macedonian main line and so threaten their rear.
As at Issus, Alexander took the command of the right wing himself, and
assigned the left to Parmenio.
</p>
<p>
As the two armies drew near, Alexander, who found himself greatly
outflanked on both wings, and saw in front of him smooth ground
carefully prepared for the operations of chariots and cavalry, began a
diagonal movement towards the right, which tended at once to place him
beyond the levelled ground, and to bring him in contact with his enemy's
left wing rather than with his direct front. The movement greatly
disconcerted his adversary, who sought to prevent it by extending and
advancing his own left, which was soon engaged with Alexander's right
in a fierce hand-to-hand conflict. Alexander still pressed his slanting
movement, and in resisting it Darius's left became separated from his
centre, while at the same time he was forced to give the signal for
launching the chariots against the foe sooner than he had intended, and
under circumstances that were not favorable. The effect of the operation
was much the same as at Cunaxa. Received by the Macedonian light-armed,
the chariots were mostly disabled before the enemy's main line was
reached; the drivers were dragged from the chariot-boards; and the
horses were cut to pieces. Such as escaped this fate and charged the
Macedonian line, were allowed to pass through the ranks, which opened to
receive them, and were then dealt with by grooms and others in the rear
of the army.
</p>
<p>
No sooner had the chariot attack failed, and the space between the two
lines of battle become clear, than Alexander, with the quick eye of a
true general, saw his opportunity: to resist his flank movement, the
Bactrians and Sacae with the greater part of the left wing had broken
off from the main Persian line, and in pressing towards the left
had made a gap between their ranks and the centre. Into this gap the
Macedonian king, at the head of the "Companion" cavalry and a portion of
the phalanx, plunged. Here he found himself in the near neighborhood
of Darius, whereupon he redoubled the vigor of his assault, knowing the
great importance of any success gained in this quarter. The Companions
rushed on with loud cries, pressing with all their weight, and thrusting
their spears into the faces of their antagonists&mdash;the phalanx, bristling
with its thick array of lances, bore them down. Alexander found himself
sufficiently near Darius to hurl a spear at him, which transfixed his
charioteer. The cry arose that the king had fallen, and the ranks at
once grew unsteady. The more timid instantly began to break and fly;
the contagion of fear spread; and Darius was in a little while almost
denuded of protection on one side. Seeing this, and regarding the battle
as lost, since his line was broken, his centre and left wing defeated,
while only his right wing remained firm, the Persian monarch yielded to
his alarm, and hastily quitting the field, made his way to Arbela. The
centre and left fled with him. The right, which was under the command
of the Syrian satrap, Mazseus, made a firmer stand. On this side the
chariots had done some damage, and the horse was more than a match for
the Thessalian cavalry. Parmenio found himself in difficulties about the
time when the Persian king fled. His messengers detained a part of the
phalanx, which was about to engage in the pursuit, and even recalled
Alexander, who was hastening upon the track of Darius. The careful
prince turned back, but before he could make his way through the crowd
of fugitives to the side of his lieutenant, victory had declared in
favor of the Macedonians in this part of the field also. Mazseus and his
troops, learning that the king was fled, regarded further resistance as
useless, and quitted the field. The Persian army hurriedly recrossed
the Zab, pursued by the remorseless conquerors, who slew the unresisting
fugitives till they were weary of slaughter. Arrian says that 300,000
fell, while a still larger number were taken prisoners. Other writers
make the loss considerably less. All, however, agree that the army was
completely routed and dispersed, that it made no attempt to rally, and
gave no further trouble to the conqueror.
</p>
<p>
The conduct of Darius in this&mdash;the crisis of his fate&mdash;cannot be
approved; but it admits of palliation, and does not compel us to
withdraw from him that respectful compassion which we commonly accord
to great misfortunes. After Issus, it was his duty to make at least one
more effort against the invader. To this object he addressed himself
with earnestness and diligence. The number and quality of the troops
collected at Arbela attests at once the zeal and success of his
endeavors. His choice and careful preparation of the field of battle
are commendable; in his disposition of his forces there is nothing with
which to find fault. Every arm of the service had full room to act; all
were brought into play; if Alexander conquered, it was because he was a
consummate general, while at the same time he commanded the best troops
in the world. Arbela was not, like Issus, won by mere fighting. It was
the leader's victory, rather than the soldiers. Alexander's diagonal
advance, the confusion which it caused, the break in the Persian line,
and its prompt occupation by some of the best cavalry and a portion
of the phalanx, are the turning-points of the engagement. All the
rest followed as a matter of course. Far too much importance has been
assigned to Darius's flight, which was the effect rather than the cause
of victory. When the centre of an Asiatic army is so deeply penetrated
that the person of the monarch is exposed and his near attendants begin
to fall, the battle is won. Darius did not&mdash;indeed he could not&mdash;"set
the example of flight." Hemmed in by vast masses of troops, it was not
until their falling away from him on his left flank at once exposed
him to the enemy and gave him room to escape, that he could extricate
himself from the melee.
</p>
<p>
No doubt it would have been nobler, finer, more heroic, had the Persian
monarch, seeing that all was lost, and that the Empire of the Persians
was over, resolved not to outlive the independence of his country. Had
he died in the thick of the fight, a halo of glory would have surrounded
him. But, because he lacked, in common with many other great kings and
commanders, the quality of heroism, we are not justified in affixing to
his memory the stigma of personal cowardice. Like Pompey, like
Napoleon, he yielded in the crisis of his fate to the instinct of
self-preservation. He fled from the field where he had lost his crown,
not to organize a new army, not to renew the contest, but to prolong for
a few weeks a life which had ceased to have any public value.
</p>
<p>
It is needless to pursue further the dissolution of the Empire.
The fatal blow was struck at Arbela&mdash;all the rest was but the long
death-agony. At Arbela the crown of Cyrua passed to the Macedonian;
the Fifth Monarchy came to an end. The HE-GOAT, with the notable horn
between his eyes, had come from the west to the ram which had two horns,
and had run into him with the fury of his power. He had come close to
him, and, moved with choler, had smitten the ram and broken his two
horns&mdash;there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he had
cast him down to the ground and stamped upon him&mdash;and there was none to
deliver the ram out of his hand.
