    CHAPTER IV. LANGUAGE AND WRITING.
</h2>
<p>
It has been intimated in the account of the Median Empire which was
given in a former-volume that the language of the Persians, which was
identical, or almost identical, with that of the Medes, belonged to the
form of speech known to moderns as Indo-European. The characteristics of
that form of speech are a certain number of common, or at least
widely spread, roots, a peculiar mode of inflecting, together with
a resemblance in the inflections, and a similarity of syntax or
construction. Of the old Persian language the known roots are, almost
without exception, kindred forms to roots already familiar to the
philologist through the Sanscrit, or the Zend, or both; while many are
of that more general type of which we have spoken&mdash;forms common to all,
or most of the varieties of the Indo-European stock. To instance in a
few very frequently recurring words&mdash;"father" is in old Persian (as
in Sanscrit) <i>pitar</i>, which differs only in the vocalization from the
Zendic <i>patar</i>, the Greek [ ], and the Latin <i>pater</i>, and of which
cognate forms are the Gothic <i>fadar</i>, the German voter, the English
<i>father</i>, and the Erse <i>athair</i>.

The ordinary Persian writing was identical with that which has been
described in the second volume of this work as Median. A cuneiform
alphabet, consisting of some thirty-six or thirty-seven forms,
expressive of twenty-three distinct sounds, sufficed for the wants of
the people, whose language was simple and devoid of phonetic luxuriance.
Writing was from left to right, as with the Arian nations generally.
Words were separated from one another by an oblique wedge; and were
divided at any point at which the writer happened to reach the end of
a line. Enclitics were joined without any break to the words which they
accompanied.
</p>
<p>
The Persian writing which has come down to us is almost entirely upon
stone. It comprises various rock tablets, a number of inscriptions upon
buildings, and a few short legends upon vases and cylinders. It is in
every case incised or cut into the material. The letters are of various
sizes, some (as those at Elwend) reaching a length of about two inches,
others (those, for instance, on the vases) not exceeding the sixth of
an inch. The inscriptions cover a space of at least a hundred and eighty
years, commencing with Cyrus, and terminating with Artaxerxes Ochus,
the successor of Mnemon. The style of the writing is, on the whole,
remarkably uniform, the latter inscriptions containing only two
characters unknown to the earlier times. Orthography, however, and
grammar are in these later inscriptions greatly changed, the character
of the changes being indicative of corruption and decline, unless,
indeed, we are to ascribe them to mere ignorance on the part of the
engravers.
</p>
<p>
There can be little doubt that, besides the cuneiform character, which
was only suited for inscriptions, the Persians employed a cursive
writing for common literary purposes. Ctesias informs us that the royal
archives were written on parchment; and there is abundant evidence that
writing was an art perfectly familiar to the educated Persian. It might
have been supposed that the Pehlevi, as the lineal descendant of the
Old Persian language, would have furnished valuable assistance towards
solving the question of what character the Persians employed commonly;
but the alphabetic type of the Pehlevi inscriptions is evidently
Semitic; and it would thus seem that the old national modes of writing
had been completely lost before the establishment by Ardeshir, son of
Babek, of the new Persian Empire.

If in the old world the fame of the Persians, as builders and artists,
fell on the whole below that of the Assyrians and Babylonians&mdash;their
instructors in art, no less than in letters and science&mdash;it was not so
much that they had not produced works worthy of comparison with those
which adorned Babylon and Nineveh, as that, boasting less antiquity and
less originality than those primitive races, they did not strike in the
same way the imagination of the lively Greeks, who moreover could not
but feel a certain jealousy of artistic successes, which had rewarded
the efforts of a living and rival people. It happened, moreover, that
the Persian masterpieces were less accessible to the Greeks than the
Babylonian, and hence there was actually less knowledge of their real
character in the time when Greek literature was at its best. Herodotus
and Xenophon, who impressed on their countrymen true ideas of the
grandeur and magnificence of the Mesopotamian structures, never
penetrated to Persia Proper, and perhaps never beheld a real Persian
building. Ctesias, it is true, as a resident at the Achaemenian Court
for seventeen years, must certainly have seen Susa and Ecbatana, if not
even Persepolis, and he therefore must have been well acquainted with
the character of Persian palaces; but, so far as appears from the
fragments of his work which have come down to us, he said but little
on the subject of these edifices. It was not until Alexander led his
cohorts across the chain of Zagros to the high plateau beyond, that a
proper estimate of the great Persian buildings could be made; and then
the most magnificent of them all was scarcely seen before it was laid
in ruins. The barbarous act of the great Macedonian conqueror, in
committing the palace of Persepolis to the flames, tended to prevent
a full recognition of the real greatness of Persian art even after the
Greeks had occupied the country; but we find from this time a certain
amount of acknowledgment of its merits&mdash;a certain number of passages,
which, like that which forms the heading to this chapter, admit alike
its grandeur and its magnificence.
</p>
<p>
If, however, the ancients did less than justice to the efforts of the
Persians in architecture, sculpture, and the kindred arts, moderns have,
on the contrary, given them rather an undue prominence. From the
middle of the seventeenth century, when Europeans first began freely to
penetrate the East, the Persian ruins, especially those of Persepolis,
drew the marked attention of travellers; and in times when the site of
Babylon had attracted but scanty notice, and that of Nineveh and the
other great Assyrian cities was almost unknown, English, French, and
German savans measured, described, and figured the Persian remains with
a copiousness and exactness that left little to desire. Chardin, the
elder Mebuhr, Le Brun, Ouseley, Ker Porter, exerted themselves with the
most praiseworthy zeal to represent fully and faithfully the marvels of
the Chehl Minar; and these persevering efforts were followed within no
very lengthy period by the splendid and exhaustive works of the Baron
Texier and of MM. Flandin and Coste. Persepolis rose again from its
ashes in the superb and costly volumes of these latter writers, who
represented on the grandest scale, and in the most finished way,
not only the actual but the ideal&mdash;not only the present but the
past&mdash;placing before our eyes at once the fullest and completest views
of the existing ruins, and also restorations of the ancient structures,
some of them warm with color and gilding, which, though to a certain
extent imaginary, probably give to a modern the best notion that it is
now possible to form of an old Persian edifice.
</p>
<p>
It is impossible within the limits of the present work, and with the
resources at the author's command, to attempt a complete description of
the Persian remains, or to vie with writers who had at their disposal
all the modern means of illustration. By the liberality of a well-known
authority on architecture, he is able to present his readers with
certain general views of the most important structures; and he also
enjoys the advantage of illustrating some of the most curious of the
details with engravings from a set of photographs recently taken. These
last have, it is believed, an accuracy beyond that of any drawings
hitherto made, and will give a better idea than words could possibly do
of the merit of the sculptures. With these helps, and with the addition
of reduced copies from some of MM. Flandin and Coste's plates, the
author hopes to be able to make his account fairly intelligible, and to
give his readers the opportunity of forming a tolerably correct judgment
on the merit of the Persian art in comparison with that of Babylon and
Assyria.
</p>
<p>
Persian architectural art displayed itself especially in two forms of
building&mdash;the palace and the tomb. Temples were not perhaps unknown in
Persia, though much of the worship may always have been in the open
air; but temples, at least until the time of Artaxerxes Mnemon, were
insignificant, and neither attracted the attention of contemporaries,
nor were of such a character as to leave traces of themselves to after
times. The palaces of the Persian kings, on the other hand, and the
sepulchres which they prepared for themselves, are noticed by many
ancient writers as objects of interest; and, notwithstanding certain
doubts which have been raised in recent years, it seems tolerably
certain that they are to be recognized in the two chief classes of
ancient ruins which still exist in the country.
</p>
<p>
The Persian palatial buildings, of which traces remain, are four in
number. One was situated at Ecbatana, the Median capital, and was a sort
of adjunct to the old residence of the Median kings. Of this only a very
few vestiges have been hitherto found; and we can merely say that it
appears to have been of the same general character with the edifices
which will be hereafter described. Another was built by Darius and
his son Xerxes on the great mound of Susa; and of this we have the
ground-plan, in a great measure, and various interesting details. A
third stood within the walls of the city of Persepolis, but of this not
much more is left than of the construction at Ecbatana. Finally, there
was in the neighborhood of Persepolis, but completely distinct from the
town, the Great Palace, which, as the chief residence, at any rate of
the later kings, Alexander burnt, and of which the remains still to
be seen are ample, constituting by far the most remarkable group of
buildings now existing in this part of Asia.
</p>
<p>
It is to this last edifice, or group of edifices, that the reader's
attention will be specially directed in the following pages. Here the
greatest of the Persian monarchs seem to have built the greatest of
their works. Here the ravages of time and barbarism, sadly injurious
as they may have been, have had least effect. Here, moreover, modern
research has spent its chief efforts, excavations having been made,
measurements effected, and ground-plans laid down with accuracy. In
describing the Persepolitan buildings we have aids which mostly fail us
elsewhere&mdash;charts, plans, drawings in extraordinary abundance and often
of high artistic value, elaborate descriptions, even photographs. <a href="#image-0016">[PLATE
XXXVIII., Fig. 3.]</a> If the describer has still a task of some difficulty
to perform, it is because an overplus of material is apt to cause almost
as much embarrassment as too poor and scanty a supply.

<p>
The buildings at Persepolis are placed upon a vast platform. It was
the practice of the Persians, as of the Assyrians and Babylonians, to
elevate their palaces in this way. They thus made them at once more
striking to the eye, more dignified, and more easy to guard. In
Babylonia an elevated habitation was also more healthy and more
pleasant, being raised above the reach of many insects, and laid open to
the winds of heaven, never too boisterous in that climate. Perhaps the
Assyrians and Persians in their continued use of the custom, to some
extent followed a fashion, elevating their royal residences, not so much
for security or comfort, as because it had come to be considered that a
palace ought to have a lofty site, and to look down on the habitations
of meaner men; but, however this may have been, the custom certainly
prevailed, and at Persepolis we have, in an almost perfect condition,
this first element of a Persian palace. <a href="#image-0017">[PLATE XXXIX.]</a>
</p>
<a name="image-0017"><!--IMG--></a>
<center>
<img src="images/plate039.jpg" height="581" width="963"
alt="Plate Xxxix. 
">
</center>

<p>
The platform at Persepolis is built at the foot of a high range of
rocky hills, on which it abuts towards the east. It is composed of solid
masses of hewn stone, which were united by metal clamps, probably of
iron or lead. The masses were not cut to a uniform size, nor even always
to a right angle, but were fitted together with a certain amount
of irregularity, which will be the best understood from the woodcut
overleaf. Many of the blocks were of enormous size; and their
quarrying, transport, and elevation to their present places, imply very
considerable mechanical skill. They were laid so as to form a perfectly
smooth perpendicular wall, the least height of which above the
plain below is twenty feet. The outline of the platform was somewhat
irregular. Speaking roughly, we may call it an oblong square, with a
breadth about two thirds of its length; but this description, unless
qualified, will give an idea of far greater uniformity than actually
prevails. <a href="#image-0018">[PLATE XL., Fig. 1.]</a> The most serious irregularity is on the
north side, the general line of which is not parallel to the south side,
nor at right angles with the western one, but forms with the general
line of the western an angle of about eighty degrees. The cause of this
deviation lay probably in the fact that, on this side, a low rocky
spur ran out from the mountain-range in this direction, and that it
was thought desirable to accommodate the line of the structure to the
natural irregularities of the ground. In addition to the irregularity
of general outline thus produced, there is another of such perpetual
occurrence that it must be regarded as an essential element of the
original design, and therefore probably as approving itself to the
artistic notions of the builder. This is the occurrence of frequent
angular projections and indentations, which we remark on all three sides
of the platform equally, and which would therefore seem to have been
regarded in Persia, no less than in Assyria, as ornamental.
</p>
<a name="image-0018"><!--IMG--></a>
<center>
<img src="images/plate040.jpg" height="950" width="567"
alt="Plate Xl. 
">
</center>

<p>
The whole of the platform is not of a uniform height. On the contrary,
it seems to have been composed, as originally built, of several quite
distinct terraces. Three of these still remain, exhibiting towards the
west a very marked difference of elevation. The lowest of the three is
on the south side, and it may therefore be termed the Southern Terrace.
It extends from east to west a distance of about 800 feet, with a width
of about 170 or 180, and has an elevation above the plain of from twenty
to twenty-three feet. Opposite to this, on the northern side of the
platform, is a second terrace, more than three times the breadth of the
southern one, which may be called, by way of distinction, the Northern
Terrace. This has an elevation above the plain of thirty-five feet.
Intermediate between these two is the great Central or Upper Terrace,
standing forty-five feet above the plain, having a length of 770 feet
along the west face of the platform, and a width of about 400. Upon
this Upper Terrace were situated almost all the great and important
buildings.
</p>
<p>
The erection of a royal residence on a platform composed of several
terraces involved the necessity of artificial ascents, which the
Persian architects managed by means of broad and solid staircases. These
staircases constitute one of the most remarkable features of the place,

The first, and grandest in respect of scale, is on the west front of the
platform towards its northern end, and leads up from the plain to the
summit of the northern terrace, furnishing the only means by which the
platform can even now be ascended. It consists of two distinct sets of
steps, each composed of two flights, with a broad landing-place between
them, the steps themselves running at right angles to the platform wall,
and the two lower flights diverging, while the two upper ones converge
to a common landing-place on the top. The slope of the stairs is so
gentle that, though each step has a convenient width, the height of a
step is in no case more than from three to four inches. It is thus
easy to ride horses both up and down the staircase, and travellers are
constantly in the habit of ascending and descending it in this way.
</p>
<p>
The width of the staircase is twenty-two feet&mdash;space sufficient to allow
of ten horsemen ascending each flight of steps abreast. Altogether this
ascent, which is on a plan unknown elsewhere, is pronounced to be the
noblest example of a flight of stairs to be found in any part of the
world. It does not project beyond the line of the platform whereto it
leads, but is, as it were, taken out of it. <a href="#plate042">[PLATE XLII.]</a>

<p>
The next, and in some respects the most remarkable of all the
staircases, conducts from the level of the northern platform to that of
the central or upper terrace. This staircase fronts northward, and opens
on the view as soon as the first staircase (A on the plan) has been
ascended, lying to the right of the spectator at the distance of about
fifty or sixty yards. It consists of four single flights of steps, two
of which are central, facing one another, and leading to a projecting
landing-place (B), about twenty feet in width; while the two others
are on either side of the central flights, distant from them about
twenty-one yards. The entire length of this staircase is 212 feet;
its greatest projection in front of the line of the terrace whereon it
abuts, is thirty-six feet. The steps, which are sixteen feet wide, rise
in the same gentle way as those of the lower or platform staircase. The
height of each is under four inches; and thus there are thirty-one steps
in an ascent of ten feet.
</p>
<p>
The feature which specially distinguishes this staircase from the lower
one already described is its elaborate ornamentation. The platform
staircase is perfectly plain. The entire face which this staircase
presents to the spectator is covered with sculptures. In the first
place, on the central projection, which is divided perpendicularly into
three compartments, are represented, in the spandrels on either side,
a lion devouring a bull, and in the compartment between the spandrels
eight colossal Persian guardsmen, armed with spears and either with
sword or shield. Further, above the lion and bull, towards the edge of
the spandrel where it slopes, forming a parapet to the steps, <a href="#image-0020">[PLATE
XLIII., Fig. 1.]</a> there was a row of cypress trees, while at the end of
the parapet and along the whole of its inner face were a set of small
figures, guardsmen habited like those in the central compartment, but
carrying mostly a bow and quiver instead of a shield. Along the extreme
edge of the parapet externally was a narrow border thickly set with
rosettes. <a href="#image-0020">[PLATE XLIII., Fig. 2.]</a> Next, in the long spaces between the
central stairs and those on either side of them, the spandrels contain
repetitions of the lion and bull sculpture, while between them and the
central stairs the face of the wall is divided horizontally into three
bands, each of which has been ornamented with a continuous row of
figures. The highest row of the three is unfortunately mutilated, the
upper portion of all the bodies being lost in consequence of their
having been sculptured upon a parapet wall built originally to protect
the edge of the terrace, but now fallen away. The middle and lowest rows
are tolerably perfect, and possess considerable interest, as well as
some artistic merit. The entire scene represented on the right side
seems to be the bringing of tribute or presents to the monarch by the
various nations under his sway. On the left-hand side this subject was
continued to a certain extent; but the greater part of the space was
occupied by representations of guards and officers of the court, the
guards being placed towards the centre, and, as it were, keeping the
main stairs, while the officers were at a greater distance. The three
rows of figures were separated from one another by narrow bands, thickly
set with rosettes.

<p>
The builder of this magnificent work was not content to leave it to
history or tradition to connect his name with his construction, but
determined to make the work itself the means of perpetuating his memory.
In three conspicuous parts of the staircase, slabs were left clear of
sculpture, undoubtedly to receive inscriptions commemorative of the
founder. The places selected were the front of the middle staircase, the
exact centre of the whole work, and the space adjoining the spandrels to
the extreme right and the extreme left. In one instance alone, however,
was this part of the work completed. On the right hand, or western
extremity of the staircase, an inscription of thirty lines in the old
Persian language informs us that the constructor was "Xerxes, the Great
King, the King of Kings, the son of King Darius, the Achaemenian." The
central and left-hand tablets, intended probably for Babylonian and
Scythic translations of the Persian legend, were never inscribed, and
remain blank to the present day.
</p>
<p>
The remaining staircases will not require very lengthy or elaborate
descriptions. They are six in number, and consist, in most instances,
of a double flight of steps, similar to the central portion of the
staircase which has been just described. Two of them (e and f) belonged
to the building marked as the "Palace of Darius" on the plan, and gave
entrance to it from the central platform above which it is elevated
about fourteen or fifteen feet. Two others (c and d) belonged to the
"Palace of Xerxes." These led up to a broad paved space in front of
that building, which formed a terrace, elevated about ten feet above
the general level of the central platform. Their position was at the two
ends of the terrace, opposite to one another; but in other respects
they cannot be said to have matched. The eastern, which consisted of two
double flights, was similar in general arrangement to the staircase by
which the platform was mounted from the plain, excepting that it was not
recessed, but projected its full breadth beyond the line of the terrace.
It was decidedly the more elegant of the two, and evidently formed the
main approach. It was adorned with the usual bull and lion combats, with
figures of guardsmen, and with attendants carrying articles needed for
the table or the toilet. The inscriptions upon it declare it to be
the work of Xerxes. <a href="#image-0021">[PLATE XLIV.]</a> The western staircase was composed
merely of two single flights, facing one another, with a narrow
landing-place between them. It was ornamented like the eastern, but
somewhat less elaborately.

</center>

<p>
A staircase, very similar to this last, but still one with certain
peculiarities, was built by Artaxerxes Ochus, at the west side of the
Palace of Darius, in order to give it a second entrance. <a href="#image-0022">[PLATE XLV.,
Fig. 1.]</a> There the spandrels have the usual figures of the lion and
bull; but the intermediate space is somewhat unusually arranged. It is
divided vertically and horizontally into eight squared compartments,
three on either side, and two in the middle. The upper of these two
contains nothing but a winged circle, the emblem of Divinity being thus
placed reverently by itself. Below, in a compartment of double size, is
an inscription of Ochus, barbarous in language, but very religious in
tone. The six remaining compartments had each four figures, representing
tribute-bearers introduced to the royal presence by a court officer.

</center>

<p>
The other, and original, staircase to this palace (f on the plan) was
towards the north, and led up to the great portico, which was anciently
its sole entrance. Two flights of steps, facing each other, conducted to
a paved space of equal extent with the portico and projecting in front
of it about five feet. On the base of the staircase were sculptures in
a single line&mdash;the lion and bull in either spandrel&mdash;and between the
spandrels eighteen colossal guardsmen, nine facing either way towards
a central inscription, which was repeated in other languages on slabs
placed between the guardsmen and the bulls. Above the spandrels, on
the parapet which fenced the stairs, was a line of figures representing
attendants bringing into the palace materials for the banquet. A similar
line adorned the inner wall of the staircase.
</p>
<p>
Opposite to this, at the distance of about thirty-two yards, was another
very similar staircase, leading up to the portico of another
building, erected (apparently) by Artaxerxes Ochus, which occupied the
south-western corner of the upper platform. The sculptures here seem to
have been of the usual character but they are so mutilated that no very
decided opinion can be passed upon them.
</p>
<p>
Last of all, a staircase of a very peculiar character, (h on the plan)
requires notice. This is a flight of steps cut in the solid rock,
which leads up from the southern terrace to the upper one, at a point
intervening between the south-western edifice, or palace of Artaxerxes,
and the palace of Xerxes, or central southern edifice. These steps are
singular in facing the terrace to which they lead, instead of being
placed sideways to it. They are of rude construction, being without a
parapet, and wholly devoid of sculpture or other ornamentation.
They furnish the only communication between the southern and central
terraces.
</p>
<p>
It is a peculiarity of the Persepolitan ruins that they are not
continuous, but present to the modern inquirer the appearance, at
any rate, of a number of distinct buildings. Of these the platform
altogether contains ten, five of which are of large size, while the
remainder are comparatively insignificant.
</p>
<p>
Of the five large buildings four stand upon the central or upper
terrace, while one lies east of that terrace, between it and the
mountains. The four upon the central terrace comprise three buildings
made up of several sets of chambers, together with one great open
pillared hall, to which are attached no subordinate apartments. The
three complex edifices will be here termed "palaces," and will take
the names of their respective founders, Darius, Xerxes, and Artaxerxes
Ochus: the fourth will be called the "Great Hall of Audience." The
building between the upper terrace and the mountains will be termed the
"Great Eastern Edifice."
</p>
<p>
The "Palace of Darius," which is one of the most interesting of the
Persepolitan buildings, stands near the western edge of the platform,
midway between the "Great Hall of Audience" and the "Palace of
Artaxerxes Ochus." <a href="#image-0023">[PLATE XLVI., Fig. 1.]</a> It is a building about one
hundred and thirty five feet in length, and in breadth a little short of
a hundred. Of all the existing buildings on the platform it occupies
the most exalted position, being elevated from fourteen to fifteen feet
above the general level of the central terrace, and being thus four or
five feet higher than the "Palace of Xerxes." It fronted towards the
south, where it was approached by a double staircase of the usual
character, which led up to a deep portico of eight pillars arranged in
two rows. On either side of the portico were guard-rooms, which opened
upon it, in length twenty-three feet, and in breadth thirteen. Behind
the portico lay the main chamber, which was a square of fifty feet,
having a roof supported by sixteen pillars, arranged in four rows of
four, in line with the pillars of the portico. <a href="#image-0022">[PLATE XLV., Fig. 2.]</a>
The bases for the pillars alone remain; and it is thus uncertain whether
their material was stone or wood. They were probably light and slender,
not greatly interrupting the view. The hall was surrounded on all sides
by walls from four to five feet in thickness, in which were doors,
windows, and recesses, symmetrically arranged. The entrance from the
portico was by a door in the exact centre of the front wall, on either
side of which were two windows, looking into the portico. The
opposite, or back, wall was pierced by two doors, which faced the
intercolumniations of the side rows of pillars, as the front door faced
the intercolumniation of the central rows. Between the two doors
which pierced the back wall was a squared recess, and similar recesses
ornamented the same wall on either side of the doors. The side walls
were each pierced originally by a single doorway, between which and the
front wall was a squared recess, while beyond, between the doorways
and the back wall, were two recesses of the same character. Curiously
enough, these side doorways and recesses fronted the pillars, not the
intercolumniations.

</center>

<p>
No sculpture, so far as appears, adorned this apartment, excepting
in the doorways, which however had in every case this kind of
ornamentation. The doorways in the back wall exhibited on their jambs
figures of the king followed by two attendants, one holding a cloth, and
the other a fly-chaser. <a href="#image-0022">[PLATE XLV., Fig. 3.]</a> These figures had in every
case their faces turned towards the apartment. The front doorway showed
on its jambs the monarch followed by the parasol-bearer and the bearer
of the fly-chaser, with his back turned to the apartment, issuing forth,
as it were, from it. On the jambs of the doors of the side apartments
was represented the king in combat with a lion or a monster, the king
here in every case facing outwards, and seeming to guard the entrances
to the side chambers.
</p>
<p>
At the back of the hall, and at either side, were chambers of very
moderate dimensions. The largest were to the rear of the building,
where there seems to have been one about forty feet by twenty-three, and
another twenty-eight feet by twenty. The doorways here had sculptures,
representing attendants bearing napkins and perfumes. The side chambers,
five in number, were considerably smaller than those behind the great
hall, the largest not exceeding thirty-four feet by thirteen.
</p>
<p>
It seems probable that this palace was without any second story. There
is no vestige in any part of it of a staircase&mdash;no indication of its
height having ever exceeded from twenty-two to twenty-five feet. It was
a modest building, simple and regular, covering less than half the space
of an ordinary palace in Assyria. <a href="#image-0022">[PLATE XLV., Fig. 2.]</a> Externally,
it must have presented an appearance not very dissimilar to that of
the simpler Greek temples; distinguished from them by peculiarities of
ornamentation, but by no striking or important feature, excepting
the grand and elaborately sculptured staircase. Internally, it was
remarkable for the small number of its apartments, which seem not to
have been more than twelve or thirteen, and for the moderate size of
most of them. Even the grand central hall covered a less area than three
out of the five halls in the country palace of Sargon. The effect
of this room was probably fine, though it must have been somewhat
over-crowded with pillars. If these were, however (as is probable),
light wooden posts, plated with silver or with gold, and if the ceiling
consisted (as it most likely did) of beams, crossing each other at right
angles, with square spaces between them, all likewise coated with the
precious metals; if moreover the cold stone walls, excepting where
they were broken by a doorway, or a window, were similarly decked; if
curtains of brilliant hues hung across the entrances; if the pavement
was of many-colored stones, and in places covered with magnificent
carpets; if an elevated golden throne, under a canopy of purple, adorned
the upper end of the room, standing against the wall midway between the
two doors&mdash;if this were in truth the arrangement and ornamentation of
the apartment, we can well understand that the <i>coup d'oeil</i> must
have been effective, and the impression made on the spectator highly
pleasing. A room fifty feet square, and not much more than twenty high,
could not be very grand; but elegance of form, combined with richness
of material and splendor of coloring, may have more than compensated for
the want of that grandeur which results from mere size.
</p>
<p>
If it be inquired how a palace of the dimensions described can have
sufficed even for one of the early Persian kings, the reply must
seemingly be that the building in question can only have contained
the public apartments of the royal residence&mdash;the throne-room,
banqueting-rooms, guard-rooms, etc.,&mdash;and that it must have been
supplemented by at least one other edifice of a considerable size, the
Gynaeceum or "House of the Women." There is ample room on the platform
for such a building, either towards the east, where the ground is now
occupied by a high mound of rubbish, or on the west, towards the edge of
the platform, where traces of a large edifice were noted by Niebuhr. On
the whole, this latter situation seems to be the more probable; and the
position of the Gynaeceum in this quarter may account for the alteration
made by Artaxerxes Ochus in the palace of Darius, which now seriously
interferes with its symmetry. Artaxerxes cut a doorway in the outer
western wall, and another opposite to it in the western wall of the
great hall, adding at the same time a second staircase to the building,
which thus became accessible from the west no less than from the south.
It has puzzled the learned in architecture to assign a motive for this
alteration. May we not find an adequate one in the desire to obtain a
ready and comparatively private access to the Gynaeceum, which must have
been somewhere on the platform, and which may well have lain in this
direction?
</p>
<p>
The minute account which has been now given of this palace will render
unnecessary a very elaborate description of the remainder. Two grand
palatial edifices seem to have been erected on the platform by later
kings&mdash;one by Xerxes and the other by Artaxerxes Ochus; but the latter
of these is in so ruined a condition, and the former is so like the
palace of Darius, that but few remarks need be made upon either. The
palace of Xerxes is simply that of Darius on a larger scale, the pillars
in the portico being increased from two rows of four to two rows of six,
and the great hall behind being a square of eighty instead of a square
of fifty feet, with thirty-six instead of sixteen pillars to support
its roof. On either side of the hall, and on either side of the portico,
were apartments like those already described as abutting on the same
portions of the older palace, differing from them chiefly in being
larger and more numerous. The two largest, which were thirty-one feet
square, had roofs supported on pillars, the numbers of such supports
being in each case four. The only striking difference in the plans of
the two buildings consisted in the absence from the palace of Xerxes of
any apartments to the rear of the great hall. In order to allow space
for an ample terrace in front, the whole edifice was thrown back so
close to the edge of the upper platform that no room was left for any
chambers at the back, since the hall itself was here brought almost to
the very verge of the sheer descent from the central to the low southern
terrace. In ornamentation the palaces also very closely resembled each
other, the chief difference being that the combats of the king with
lions and mythological monsters, which form the regular ornamentation
of the side-chambers in the palace of Darius, occur nowhere in the
residence of his son, where they are replaced by figures of attendants
bringing articles for the toilet or the table, like those which adorn
the main staircase of the older edifice. Figures of the same kind also
ornament all the windows in the palace of Xerxes. A tone of mere sensual
enjoyment is thus given to the later edifice, which is very far from
characterizing the earlier; and the decline of morals at the Court,
which history indicates as rapid about this period, is seen to
have stamped itself, as such changes usually do, upon the national
architecture.
</p>
<p>
A small building, at the distance of about twenty or twenty-five yards
from the eastern wall of the palace of Xerxes, possesses a peculiar
interest, in consequence of its having some claims to be considered
the most ancient structure upon the platform. It consists of a hall and
portico, in size, proportions, and decoration almost exactly resembling
the corresponding parts of Darius's palace, but unaccompanied by any
trace of circumjacent chambers, and totally devoid of inscriptions. The
building is low, on the level of the northern, rather than on that of
the central terrace, and is indeed half buried in the rubbish which has
accumulated at its base. Its fragments are peculiarly grand and massive,
while its sculptures are in strong and bold relief. There can be little
doubt but that it was originally, like the hall and portico of Darius,
surrounded on three sides by chambers. These, however, have entirely
disappeared, having probably been pulled down to furnish materials for
more recent edifices. Like the palaces of Xerxes and Artaxerxes Ochus,
and unlike the palace of Darius, the building faces to the north, which
is the direction naturally preferred in such a climate. We may suppose
it to have been the royal residence of the earlier times, the erection
of Cyrus or Cambyses, and to have been intended especially for summer
use, for which its position well fitted it. Darius, wishing for a winter
palace at Persepolis, as well as a summer one, took probably this early
palace for his model, and built one as nearly as possible resembling it,
except that, for the sake of greater warmth, he made his new erection
face southwards. Xerxes, dissatisfied with the size of the old summer
palace, built a new one at its side of considerably larger dimensions,
using perhaps some of the materials of the old palace in his new
building. Finally, Artaxerxes Ochus made certain additions to the palace
of Xerxes on its western side, and at the same time added a staircase
and a doorway to the winter residence of Darius. Thus the Persepolitan
palace, using the word in its proper sense of royal residence, attained
its full dimensions, occupying the southern half of the great central
platform, and covering with its various courts and buildings a space
500 feet long by 375 feet wide, or nearly the space covered by the less
ambitious of the palaces of Assyria.
</p>
<p>
Besides edifices adapted for habitation, the Persepolitan platform
sustained two other classes of buildings. These were propylaea, or
gateways&mdash;places commanding the approach to great buildings, where a
guard might be stationed to stop and examine all comers&mdash;and halls of a
vast size, which were probably throne-rooms, where the monarch held
his court on grand occasions, to exhibit himself in full state to his
subjects. The propylaea upon the platform appear to have been four
in number. One, the largest, was directly opposite the centre of the
landing-place at the top of the great stairs which gave access to the
platform from the plain. This consisted of a noble apartment, eighty-two
feet square, with a roof supported by four magnificent columns, each
between fifty and sixty feet high. The walls of the apartment were from
sixteen to seventeen feet thick. Two grand portals, each twelve feet
wide by thirty-six feet high, led into this apartment, one directly
facing the head of the stairs, and the other opposite to it, towards the
east. Both were flanked with colossal bulls, those towards the staircase
being conventional representations of the real animal, while the
opposite pair are almost exact reproductions of the winged and
human-headed bulls, with which the Assyrian discoveries have made us so
familiar. The accompanying illustration <a href="#image-0024">[PLATE XLVII., Fig. 1.]</a>, which
is taken from a photograph, exhibits this inner pair in their present
condition. The back of one of the other pair is also visible. Two of
the pillars&mdash;which alone are still standings appear in their places,
intervening between the front and the back gateway.

</center>

<p>
The walls which enclosed this chamber, notwithstanding their immense
thickness, have almost entirely disappeared. On the southern side alone,
where there seems to have been a third doorway, unornamented, are there
any traces of them. We must conclude that they were either of burnt
brick or of small blocks of stone, which the natives of the country
in later times found it convenient to use as material for their own
buildings.
</p>
<p>
An edifice, almost exactly similar to this, but of very inferior
dimensions, occupied a position due east of the palace of Darius, and
a little to the north of the main staircase leading to the terrace in
front of the palace of Xerxes. The bases of two pillars and the jambs
of three doorways remain, from which it is easy to reconstruct the main
building. Its position seems to mark it as designed to give entrance
to the structure, whatever it was, which occupied the site of the great
mound (M on the Plan) east of Darius's palace, and north of the palace
of his son. The ornamentation, however, would rather connect it with
the more eastern of the two great pillared halls, which will have to be
described presently.
</p>
<p>
A third edifice of the same kind stood in front of the great eastern
hall, at the distance of about seventy yards from its portico. This
building is more utterly ruined than either of the preceding, and its
dimensions are open to some doubt. On the whole, it seems probable that
it resembled the great propylaea at the head of the stairs leading from
the plain rather than the central propylaea just described. Part of its
ornamentation was certainly a colossal bull, though whether human-headed
or not cannot be determined.
</p>
<p>
The fourth of the propylaea was on the terrace whereon stood the palace
of Xerxes, and directly fronting the landing-place at the head of its
principal stairs, just as the propylaea first described fronted the
great stairs leading up from the plain. Its dimensions were suited to
those of the staircase which led to it, and of the terrace on which it
was placed. It was less than one fourth the size of the great propylaea,
and about half that of the propylaea which stood the nearest to it.
The bases of the four pillars alone remain in situ; but, from the
proportions thus obtained, the position of the walls and doorways is
tolerably certain.
</p>
<p>
We have now to pass to the most magnificent of the Perse-politan
buildings&mdash;the Great Pillared Halls&mdash;which constitute the glory of Arian
architecture, and which, even in their ruins, provoke the wonder and
admiration of modern Europeans, familiar with all the triumphs of
Western art, with Grecian temples, Roman baths and amphitheatres,
Moorish palaces, Turkish mosques, and Christian cathedrals. Of these
pillared halls, the Persepolitan platform supports two, slightly
differing in their design, but presenting many points of agreement. They
bear the character of an earlier and a later building&mdash;a first effort
in the direction which circumstances compelled the architecture of the
Persians to take, and the final achievement of their best artists in
this kind of building.
</p>
<p>
Nearly midway in the platform between its northern and its southern
edges, and not very far from the boundary of rocky mountain on which
the platform abuts towards the east, is the vast edifice which has been
called with good reason the "Hall of a Hundred Columns," since its
roof was in all probability supported by that number of pillars. This
building consisted of a single magnificent chamber, with a portico, and
probably guard-rooms, in front, of dimensions quite unequalled upon
the platform. The portico was 183 feet long by 52 feet deep, and was
sustained by sixteen pillars, about 33 feet high, arranged in two rows
of eight. The great chamber behind was a square of 227 feet, and had
therefore an area of about 51,000 feet. Over this vast space were
distributed, at equal distances from one another, one hundred columns,
each 35 feet high, arranged in ten rows of ten each, every pillar thus
standing at a distance of nearly 20 feet from any other. The four walls
which enclosed this great hall had a uniform thickness of 10 1/2 feet,
and were each pierced at equal intervals by two doorways, the doorways
being thus exactly opposite to one another, and each looking down an
avenue of columns. In the spaces of wall on either side of the doorways,
eastward, westward, and southward, were three niches, all square-topped,
and bearing the ornamentation which is universal in the case of all
niches, windows, and doorways in the Persepolitan ruins. <a href="#image-0024">[PLATE XLVII.,
Fig. 2.]</a> In the northern, or front, wall, the niches were replaced by
windows looking upon the portico, excepting towards the angles of the
building, where niches were retained, owing to a peculiarity in the
plan of the edifice which has now to be noticed. The portico, instead
of being, as in every other Persian instance, of the same width with the
building which it fronted, was 44 feet narrower, its antce projecting
from the front wall, not at either extremity, but at the distance of 11
feet from the corner. While the porch was thus contracted, so that the
pillars had to be eight in each row instead of ten, space was left on
either side for a narrow guard-room opening on to the porch, indications
of which are seen in the doorways placed at right angles to the front
wall, which are ornamented with the usual figures of soldiers armed
with spear and shield. It has been suggested that the hall was, like the
smaller pillared chambers upon the platform, originally surrounded on
three sides by a number of lesser apartments; and this is certainly
possible: but no trace remains of any such buildings. The ornamentation
which exists seems to show that the building was altogether of a public
character. Instead of exhibiting attendants bringing articles for the
toilet or the banquet, it shows on its doors the monarch, either engaged
in the art of destroying symbolical monsters, or seated on his throne
under a canopy, with the tiara on his head, and the golden sceptre in
his right hand. The throne representations are of two kinds. On the
jambs of the great doors leading out upon the porch, we see in the top
compartment the monarch seated under the canopy, accompanied by five
attendants, while below him are his guards, arranged in five rows of
ten each, some armed with spears and shields, others with spears, short
swords, bows and quivers. Thus the two portals together exhibit the
figures of 200 Persian guardsmen in attendance on the person of the
king. The doors at the back of the building present us with a still
more curious sculpture. On these the throne appears elevated on a lofty
platform, the stages of which, three in number, are upheld by figures
in different costumes, representing apparently the natives of all the
different provinces of the Empire. It is a reasonable conjecture that
this great hall was intended especially for a throne-room, and that in
the representations on these doorways we have figured a structure which
actually existed under its roof (probably at t in the plan)&mdash;a platform
reached by steps, whereon, in the great ceremonies of state, the royal
throne was placed, in order that the monarch might be distinctly seen at
one and the same time by the whole Court.

<p>
The question of the lighting of this huge apartment presents some
difficulties. On three sides, as already observed, the hall had (so
far as appears) no windows&mdash;the places where windows might have been
expected to occur being occupied by niches. The apparent openings are
consequently reduced to some fifteen, viz., the eight doorways, and
seven windows, which looked out upon the portico, and were therefore
overhung and had a north aspect. It is clear that sufficient light could
not have entered the apartment from these&mdash;the only visible&mdash;apertures.
We must therefore suppose either that the walls above the niches were
pierced with windows, which is quite possible, or else that light was in
some way or other admitted from the roof. The latter is the supposition
of those most competent to decide. M. Flandin conjectures that the roof
had four apertures, placed at the points where the lines drawn from
the northern to the southern, and those drawn from the eastern to the
western, doors would intersect one another. He seems to suppose that
these openings were wholly unprotected, in which case they would have
admitted, in a very inconvenient way, both the sun and the rain. May we
not presume that, if such openings existed, they were guarded by louvres
such as have been regarded as probably lighting the Assyrian halls, and
of which a representation has already been given?
</p>
<p>
The portico of the Hall of a Hundred Columns was flanked on either side
by a colossal bull, standing at the inner angle of the antes, and thus
in some degree narrowing the entrance. Its columns were fluted, and
had in every case the complex capital, which occurs also in the great
propylaea and in the Hall of Xerxes. It was built of the same sort of
massive blocks as the south-eastern edifice, or Ancient Palace&mdash;blocks
often ten feet square by seven feet thick, and may be ascribed probably
to the same age as that structure. Like that edifice, it is situated
somewhat low; it has no staircase, and no inscription. We may fairly
suppose it to have been the throne-room or great hall of audience of the
early king who built the South-eastern Palace.
</p>
<p>
We have now to describe the most remarkable of all the Persepolitan
edifices&mdash;a building the remains of which stretch nearly 350 feet in one
direction, while in the other they extend 246 feet. Its ruins consist
almost entirely of pillars, which are divided into four groups. The
largest of these was a square of thirty-six pillars, arranged in six
rows of six, all exactly equidistant from one another, and covering
an area of above 20,000 square feet. On three sides of this square,
eastward, northward, and westward, were magnificent porches, each
consisting of twelve columns, arranged in two rows, in line with the
pillars of the central cluster. These porches stood at the distance of
seventy feet from the main building, and have the appearance of having
been entirely separate from it. They are 143 feet long, by thirty broad,
and thus cover each an area of 4260 feet. The most astonishing feature
in the whole building is the height of the pillars. These, according to
the measurements of M. Flandin, had a uniform altitude throughout the
building of sixty-four feet. Even in their ruin, they tower over every
other erection upon the platform, retaining often, in spite of the
effects of time, an elevation of sixty feet.
</p>
<p>
The capitals of the pillars were of three kinds. Those of the side
colonnades were comparatively simple: they consisted, in each case, of
a single member, formed, in the eastern colonnade, of two half-griffins,
with their heads looking in opposite directions <a href="#image-0024">[PLATE XLVII, Fig. 2]</a>;
and, in the western colonnade, of two half-bulls, arranged in the
same manner <a href="#image-0024">[PLATE XLVII., Fig. 3]</a>. The capitals of the pillars in the
northern colonnade, which faced the great sculptured staircase, and
constituted the true front of the building, were of a very complex
character. They may be best viewed as composed of three distinct
members&mdash;first, a sort of lotos-bud, accompanied by pendent leaves;
then, above that, a member, composed of volutes like those of the Ionic
order, but placed in a perpendicular instead of a horizontal direction;
and at the top, a member composed of two half-bulls, exactly similar to
that which forms the complete capital of the western group of pillars.
The pillars of the groat central cluster had capitals exactly like those
of the northern colonnade.
</p>
<p>
The bases of the colonnade pillars are of singular beauty. Bell-shaped,
and ornamented with a double or triple row of pendent lotus-leaves, some
rounded, some narrowed to a point; they are as graceful as they are rare
in their forms, and attract the admiration of all beholders. Above them
rise the columns, tapering gently as they ascend, but without any swell
or entasis. They consist of several masses of stone, carefully joined
together, and secured at the joints by an iron cramp in the direction of
the column's axis. All are beautifully fluted along their entire length,
the number of the incisions or flutings being from forty-eight to
fifty-two in each pillar. They are arcs of circles smaller than
semicircles, thus resembling those of the Doric, rather than those of
the Ionic or Corinthian order. The cutting of all is very exact and
regular.
</p>
<p>
There can be little doubt but that both the porches, and the
great central pillar-cluster, were roofed in. The double-bull and
double-griffin capital are exactly suited to receive the ends of beams,
which would stretch from pillar to pillar, and support a roof and an
entablature. <a href="#image-0026">[PLATE L., Fig.1.]</a> We may see in the entrances to the royal
tombs the true use of pillars in a Persian building, and the character
of the entablature which, they were intended to sustain, Assuming,
then, that both the great central pillar phalanx and the three detached
colonnades supported a roof, the question arises, were the colonnades
in any way united with the main building, or did they stand completely
detached from it? It has been supposed that they were all porticos <i>in
antis</i>, connected with the main building by solid walls&mdash;that the great
central column-cluster was surrounded on all sides by a wall of a very
massive description, from the four corners of which similar barriers
were carried down to the edge of the terrace, abutting in front upon
the steps of the great sculptured staircase, and extending eastward and
westward, so as to form the antce of an eastern and a western portico.
In the two corners between the northern in <i>antae</i> of the side porticos
and the <i>antae</i> of the portico in front are supposed to have been large
guard-rooms, entirely filling up the two angles. The whole building is
thus brought into close conformity with the "Palace of Xerxes," from
which it is distinguished only by its superior size, its use of stone
pillars, and the elongation of the tetrastyle chambers at the sides of
that edifice into porticos of twelve pillars each.

<p>
The ingenuity of this conception is unquestionable; and one is tempted
at first sight to accept a solution which removes so much that is
puzzling, and establishes so remarkable a harmony between works whose
outward aspect is so dissimilar. It seems like the inspiration of genius
to discern so clearly the like in the unlike, and one inclines at first
to believe that what is so clever cannot but be true. But a rigorous
examination of the evidence leads to an opposite conclusion, and if it
does not absolutely disprove Mr. Fergusson's theory, at any rate shows
it to be in the highest degree doubtful. Such walls as he describes,
with their <i>antae</i> and their many doors and windows, should have left
very marked traces of their existence in great squared pillars at the
sides of porticos, in huge door-frames and window-frames, or at least
in the foundations of walls, or, the marks of them, on some part of the
paved terrace. Now the entire absence of squared pillars for the ends
of antce, of door-frames, and window-frames, or even of such sculptured
fragments as might indicate their former existence, is palpable and is
admitted; nor is there any even supposed trace of the walls, excepting
in one of the lines which by the hypothesis they would occupy. In front
of the building, midway between the great pillar-cluster and the north
colonnade, are the remains of four stone bases, parallel to one another,
each seventeen feet long by five feet six inches wide. Mr. Fergusson
regards these bases as marking the position of the doors in his front
wall; and they are certainly in places where doors might have been
looked for, if the building had a front wall, since the openings are
exactly opposite the inter-columniations of the pillars, both in the
portico and in the main cluster. But there are several objections to the
notion of these bases being the foundations of the jambs of doors. In
the first place, they are too wide apart, being at the distance from one
another of seventeen feet, whereas no doorway on the platform exceeds a
width of twelve or thirteen feet. In the second place, if these massive
stone bases were prepared for the jambs of doors, it could only have
been for massive stone jambs like those of the other palaces; but
in that case, the jambs could not have disappeared. Thirdly, if the
doorways on this side were thus marked, why were they not similarly
marked on the other sides of the building? On the whole, the supposition
of M. Flandin, that the bases were pedestals for ornamental statues,
perhaps of bulls, seems more probable than that of Mr. Fergusson;
though, no doubt, there are objections also to M. Flandin's hypothesis,
and it would be perhaps best to confess that we do not know the use of
these strange foundations, which have nothing that at all resembles them
upon the rest of the platform.
</p>
<p>
Another strong objection to Mr. Fergusson's theory, and one of which
he, to a certain extent, admits the force, is the existence of drains,
running exactly in the line of his side walls, which, if such walls
existed, would be a curious provision on the part of the architect for
undermining his own work. Mr. Fergusson supposes that they might be
intended to drain the walls themselves and keep them dry. But as it is
clear that they must have carried off the whole surplus water from
the roof of the building, and as there is often much rain and snow
at Persepolis, their effect on the foundations of such a wall as Mr.
Fergusson imagines would evidently be disastrous in the extreme.
</p>
<p>
To these minute and somewhat technical objections may be added the
main one, whereof all alike can feel the force&mdash;namely, the entire
disappearance of such a vast mass of building as Mr. Fergusson's
hypothesis supposes. To account for this, Mr. Fergusson is obliged to
lay it down, that in this magnificent structure, with its solid
stone staircase, its massive pavement of the same material, and its
seventy-two stone pillars, each sixty-four feet high, the walls were of
mud. Can we believe in this incongruity? Can we imagine that a prince,
who possessed an unbounded command of human labor, and an inexhaustible
supply of stone in the rocky mountains close at hand, would have had
recourse to the meanest of materials for the walls of an edifice which
he evidently intended to eclipse all others upon the platform. And,
especially, can we suppose this, when the very same prince used solid
blocks of stone, in the walls of the very inferior edifice which he
constructed in this same locality? Mr. Fergusson, in defence of
his hypothesis, alleges the frequent combination of meanness with
magnificence in the East, and softens down the meanness in the present
case by clothing his mud walls with enamelled tiles, and painting them
with all the colors of the rainbow. But here again the hypothesis is
wholly unsupported by fact. Neither at Persepolis, nor at Pasargadae,
nor at any other ancient Persian site, has a single fragment of an
enamelled tile or brick been discovered. In Babylonia and Assyria, where
the employment of such an ornamentation was common, the traces of it
which remain are abundant. Must not the entire absence of such traces
from all exclusively Persian ruins be held to indicate that this mode of
adorning edifices was not adopted in Persia?
</p>
<p>
If then we resign the notion of this remarkable building having been a
walled structure, we must suppose that it was a summer throne-room,
open to all the winds of heaven, except so far as it was protected by
curtains. For the use of these by the Persians in pillared edifices, we
have important historical authority in the statement already quoted from
the Book of Esther. The Persian palace, to which that passage directly
refers, contained a structure almost the exact counterpart of this
at Persepolis; and it is probable that at both places the interstices
between the outer pillars of, at any rate, the great central colonnade,
were filled with "hangings of white and green and blue, fastened with
cords of white and purple to silver rings," which were attached to the
"pillars of marble;" and that by these means an undue supply of light
and air, as well as an unseemly publicity, were prevented. A traveller
in the country well observes, in allusion to this passage from Esther:
Nothing could be more appropriate than this method at Susa and
Persepolis, the spring residences of the Persian monarchs. It must be
considered that these columnar halls were the equivalents of the modern
throne-rooms, that here all public business was dispatched, and that
here the king might sit and enjoy the beauties of the landscape. With
the rich plains of Susa and Persepolis before him, he could well, after
his winter's residence at Babylon, dispense with massive walls, which
would only check the warm fragrant breeze from those verdant prairies
adorned with the choicest flowers. A massive roof, covering the whole
expanse of columns, would be too cold and dismal, whereas curtains
around the central group would serve to admit both light and warmth.
Nothing can be conceived better adapted to the climate or the season.
</p>
<p>
If the central cluster of pillars was thus adapted to the purposes of
a throne-room, equally well may the isolated colonnades have served as
ante-chambers or posts for guards. Protected, perhaps, with curtains
or awnings of their own, of a coarser material than those of the main
chamber, or at any rate casting, when the sun was high, a broad and deep
shadow, they would give a welcome shelter to those who had to watch
over the safety of the monarch, or who were expecting but had not yet
received their summons to the royal presence. Except in the very hottest
weather, the Oriental does not love to pass his day within doors. Seated
on the pavement in groups, under the deep shadows of these colonnades,
which commanded a glorious view of the vast fertile plain of the
Bendamir, of the undulating mountain-tract beyond, and of the
picturesque hills known now as Koh-Istakhr, or Koh-Rhamgherd, the
subjects of the Great King, who had business at Court, would wait,
agreeably enough, till their turn came to approach the throne.
</p>
<p>
Our survey of the Persepolitan platform is now complete; but, before we
entirely dismiss the subject of Persian palaces, it seems proper to say
a few words with respect to the other palatial remains of Achasmenian
times, remains which exist in three places&mdash;at Murgab or Pasargadse, at
Istakr, and at the great mound of Susa. The Murgab and Istakr ruins were
carefully examined by MM. Coste and Flandin; while General Williams and
Mr. Loftus diligently explored, and completely made out, the plan of the
Susian edifice.
</p>
<p>
The ruins at Murgab, which are probably the most ancient in Persia,
comprise, besides the well-known "Tomb of Cyrus," two principal
buildings. The largest of these was of an oblong-square shape, about 147
feet long by 116 wide. It seems to have been surrounded by a lofty
wall, in which were huge portals, consisting of great blocks of
stone, partially hollowed out, to render them portable. There was an
inscription on the jambs of each portal, containing the words, "I am
Cyrus the King, the Achaemenian." Within the walled enclosure which may
have been skirted internally by a colonnade was a pillared building, of
much greater height than the surrounding walls, as is evident from the
single column which remains. This shaft, which is perfectly plain, and
shows no signs of a capital, has an altitude of thirty-six feet, with
a diameter of three feet four inches at the base. On the area around,
which was carefully paved, are the bases of seven other similar pillars,
arranged in lines, and so situated as apparently to indicate an oblong
hall, supported by twelve pillars, in three rows of four each. The
chief peculiarity of the arrangement is, a variety in the width of the
intercolumniations, which measure twenty-seven feet ten inches in one
direction, but twenty-one feet only in the other. The smaller building,
which is situated at only a short distance from the larger one, covers a
space of 125 feet by fifty. It consists of twelve pillar bases, arranged
in two rows of six each, the pillars being somewhat thicker than those
of the other building, and placed somewhat closer together. <a href="#image-0027">[PLATE
XLIX., Fig. 5.]</a> The form of the base is very singular. It exhibits
at the side a semicircular bulge, ornamented with a series of nine
flutings, which are carried entirely round the base in parallel
horizontal circles. <a href="#image-0026">[PLATE L., Fig. 2.]</a> In front of the pillar bases,
at the distance of about twenty-three feet from the nearest, is a square
column, still upright, on which is sculptured a curious mythological
figure, together with the same curt legend, which appears on the larger
building&mdash;"I am Cyrus, the King, the Achaemenian."

</center>

<p>
There are two other buildings at Murgab remarkable for their masonry.
One is a square tower, with slightly projecting corners, built of
hewn blocks of stone, very regularly laid, and carried to a height
of forty-two feet. The other is a platform, exceedingly massive and
handsome, composed entirely of squared stone, and faced with blocks
often eight or ten feet long, laid in horizontal courses, and rusticated
throughout in a manner that is highly ornamental. <a href="#image-0026">[PLATE L. Fig. 3.]</a> The
style resembles that of the substructions of the Temple of Jerusalem.
It occurs occasionally, though somewhat rarely, in Greece; but there
is said to exist nowhere so extensive and beautiful a specimen of it as
that of the platform at this ancient site. <a href="#image-0026">[PLATE L., Fig. 4.]</a>
</p>
<p>
The palace at Istakr is in better preservation than either of the two
pillared edifices at Murgab; but still, it is not in such a condition as
to enable us to lay down with any certainty even its ground-plan. <a href="#image-0028">[PLATE
LI., Fig. 1.]</a> One pillar only remains erect; but the bases of eight
others have been found in situ; the walls are partly to be traced,
and the jambs of several doorways and niches are still standing. These
remains show that in many respects, as in the character of the pillars,
which were fluted and had capitals like those already described, in the
massiveness of the door and window jambs, and in the thickness of
the walls, the Istakr Palace resembled closely the buildings on the
Persepolitan platform; but at the same time they indicate that its plan
was wholly different, and thus our knowledge of the platform buildings
in no degree enables us to complete, or even to carry forward to any
appreciable extent, the ground-plan of the edifice derived from actual
research. The height of the columns, which is inferior to that of the
lowest at the great platform, would seem to indicate, either that the
building was the first in which stone pillars were attempted, or that
it was erected at a time when the Persians no longer possessed the
mechanical skill required to quarry, transport, and raise into place the
enormous blocks used in the best days of the nation.

</center>

<p>
The palace of Susa, exhumed by Mr. Loftus and General Williams,
consisted of a great Hall or Throne-room, almost exactly a duplicate
of the Chehl Minar at Persepolis, and of a few other very inferior
buildings. It stood at the summit of the great platform, a quadrilateral
mass of unburnt brick, which from a remote antiquity had supported the
residence of the old Susian kings. It fronted a little west of north,
and commanded a magnificent view over the Susianian plains to the
mountains of Lauristan. An inscription, repeated on four of its
pillar-bases, showed that it was originally built by Darius Hystaspis,
and afterwards repaired by Artaxerxes Longimanus. As it was so exactly
a reproduction of an edifice already minutely described, no further
account of it need be here given.
</p>
<p>
From the palaces of the Persian kings we may now pass to their tombs,
remarkable structures which drew the attention of the ancients, and
which have been very fully examined and represented in modern times.
These tombs are eight in number, but present only two types, so that
it will be sufficient to give in this place a detailed account of two
tombs&mdash;one of each description.
</p>
<p>
The most ancient, and, on the whole, the most remarkable of the tombs,
is almost universally allowed to be that of the Great Cyrus. It is
unique in design, totally different from all the other royal sepulchres;
and, though it has been often described, demands, and must
receive, notice in any account that is given of the ancient Persian
constructions. The historian Arrian calls it "a house upon a pedestal;"
and this brief description exactly expresses its general character. On a
base, composed of huge blocks of the most beautiful white marble,1 which
rises pyramidically in seven steps of different heights, there stands a
small "house" of similar material, crowned with a stone roof, which
is formed in front and rear into a pediment resembling that of a Greek
temple. <a href="#image-0028">[PLATE LI., Fig.3.]</a> The "house" has no window, but one of the
end walls was pierced by a low and narrow doorway, which led into a
small chamber or cell, about eleven feet long, seven broad, and seven
high. Here, as ancient writers inform us, the body of the Great Cyrus
was deposited in a golden coffin. Internally the chamber is destitute
of any inscription, and indeed seems to have been left perfectly plain.
Externally, there is a cornice of some elegance below the pediment, a
good molding over the doorway, which is also doubly recessed&mdash;and two
other very slight moldings, one at the base of the "house," and the
other at the bottom of the second step. <a href="#image-0028">[PLATE LI., Fig. 2.]</a> Except for
these, the whole edifice is perfectly plain. Its present height above
the ground is thirty-six feet, and it may originally have been a foot
or eighteen inches higher, for the top of the roof is worn away. It
measures at the base forty-seven feet by forty-three feet nine inches.
</p>
<p>
The tomb stands within a rectangular area, marked out by pillars, the
bases or broken shafts of which are still to be seen. They appear to
have been twenty-four in number; all of them circular and smooth, not
fluted; six pillars occupied each side of the rectangle, and they stood
distant from each other about fourteen feet. It is probable that they
originally supported a colonnade, which skirted internally a small
walled court, within which the tomb was placed. The capitals of the
pillars, if they had any, have wholly disappeared; and the researches
conducted on the spot have failed to discover any trace of them.
</p>
<p>
The remainder of the Persian royal sepulchres are rock-tombs,
excavations in the sides of mountains, generally at a considerable
elevation, so placed as to attract the eye of the beholder, while they
are extremely difficult of approach. Of this kind of tomb there are
four in the face of the mountain which bounds the Pulwar Valley on the
north-west, while there are three others in the immediate vicinity of
the Persepolitan platform, two in the mountain which overhangs it, and
one in the rocks a little further to the south. The general shape of
the excavations, as it presents itself to the eye of the spectator,
resembles a Greek cross. <a href="#image-0029">[PLATE LII., Fig. 1.]</a> This is divided by
horizontal lines into three portions, the upper one (corresponding with
the topmost limb of the cross) containing a very curious sculptured
representation of the monarch worshipping Ormazd; the middle one, which
comprises the two side limbs, together with the space between them,
being carved architecturally so as to resemble a portico; and the third
compartment (corresponding with the lowest limb of the cross) being left
perfectly plain. In the centre of the middle compartment is sculptured
on the face of the rock the similitude of a doorway, closely resembling
those which still stand on the great platform; that is to say, doubly
recessed, and ornamented at the top with lily-work. The upper portion of
this doorway is filled with the solid rock, smoothed to a flat surface
and crossed by three horizontal bars. The lower portion, to the height
of four or five feet, is cut away; and thus entrance is given to the
actual tomb, which is hollowed out in the rock behind.

</center>

<p>
Thus far the rock tombs, are, with scarcely an exception, of the same
type. The excavations, however, behind their ornamental fronts, present
some curious differences. In the simplest case of all, we find, on
entering, an arched chamber, thirteen feet five inches long by seven
feet two inches wide, from which there opens out, opposite to the door
and at the height of about four feet from the ground, a deep horizontal
recess, arched, like the chamber. Near the front of this recess is a
further perpendicular excavation, in length six feet ten inches, in
width three feet three inches, and in depth the same. This was the
actual sarcophagus, and was covered, or intended to be covered, by a
slab of stone. In the deeper part of the recess there is room for two
other such sarcophagi; but in this case they have not been excavated,
one burial only having, it would seem, taken place in this tomb. Other
sepulchres present the same general features, but provide for a much
greater number of interments. In that of Darius Hystaspis the sepulchral
chamber contains three distinct recesses, in each of which are three
sarcophagi, so that the tomb would hold nine bodies. It has, apparently,
been cut originally for a single recess, on the exact plan of the tomb
described above, but has afterwards been elongated towards the left.
<a href="#image-0030">[PLATE LIII., Fig. 1.]</a> Two of the tombs show a still more elaborate

A curious edifice, belonging probably to the later Achaemenian times,
stands immediately in front of the four royal tombs at Nakhsh-i-Eustam.
This is a square tower, composed of large blocks of marble, cut with
great exactness, and joined together without mortar or cement of
any kind. The building is thirty-six feet high; and each side of it
measures, as near as possible, twenty-four feet. It is ornamented with
pilasters at the corners and with six recessed niches, or false windows,
in three ranks, one over the other, on three out of its four faces. On
the fourth face are two niches only, one over the other; and below
them is a doorway with a cornice. The surface of the walls between the
pilasters is also ornamented with a number of rectangular depressions,
resembling the sunken ends of beams. The doorway, which looks north,
towards the tombs, is not at the bottom of the building, but half-way up
its side, and must have been reached either by a ladder or by a flight
of steps. It leads into a square chamber, twelve feet wide by nearly
eighteen high, extending to the top of the building, and roofed in with
four large slabs of stone, which reach entirely across from side to
side, being rather more than twenty-four feet long, six feet wide, and
from eighteen inches to three feet in thickness. <a href="#image-0030">[PLATE LIII., Fig. 3.]</a>
On the top these slabs are so cut that the roof has every way a slight
incline; at their edges they are fashioned between the pilasters, into
a dentated cornice, like that which is seen on the tomb. Externally they
were clamped together in the same careful way which we find to have been
in use both at Persepolis and Parsargadae. The building seems to have
been closed originally by two ponderous stone doors. <a href="#image-0031">[PLATE LIV., Fig.

<p>
Another remarkable construction, which must belong to a very ancient
period in the history of the country, is a gateway composed of enormous
stones, which forms a portion of the ruins of Istakr. <a href="#image-0031">[PLATE LIV., Fig.
2.]</a> It has generally been regarded as one of the old gates of the city;
but its position in the gorge between the town wall and the opposite
mountain, and the fact that it lies directly across the road from
Pasargadae into the plain of Merdasht, seem rather to imply that it was
one of those fortified "gates," which we know to have been maintained by
the Persians, at narrow points along their great routes, for the purpose
of securing them, and stopping the advance of an enemy. On either
side were walls of vast thickness, on the one hand abutting upon the
mountain, on the other probably connected with the wall of the town,
while between them were three massive pillars, once, no doubt, the
supports of a tower, from which the defenders of the gate would engage
its assailants at a great advantage.
</p>
<p>
We have now described (so far as our data have rendered it possible)
all the more important of the ancient edifices of the Persians, and
may proceed to consider the next branch of the present inquiry, namely,
their skill in the mimetic arts. Before, however, the subject of their
architecture is wholly dismissed, a few words seem to be required on its
general character and chief peculiarities.
</p>
<p>
First, then, the simplicity and regularity of the style are worthy of
remark. In the ground-plans of buildings the straight line only is used;
all the angles are right angles; all the pillars fall into line; the
intervals between pillar and pillar are regular, and generally equal;
doorways are commonly placed opposite intercolumniations; where there is
but one doorway, it is in the middle of the wall which it pierces; where
there are two, they correspond to one another. Correspondence is the
general law. Not only does door correspond to door, and pillar to
pillar, but room to room, window to window, and even niche to niche.
Most of the buildings are so contrived that one half is the exact
duplicate of the other; and where this is not the case, the irregularity
is generally either slight, or the result of an alteration, made
probably for convenience sake. Travellers are impressed with the Grecian
character of what they behold, though there is an almost entire absence
of Greek forms. The regularity is not confined to single buildings, but
extends to the relations of different edifices one to another. The sides
of buildings standing on one platform, at whatever distance they may be,
are parallel. There is, however, less consideration paid than we should
have expected to the exact position, with respect to a main building,
in which a subordinate one shall be placed. Propylaea, for instance,
are not opposite the centre of the edifice to which they conduct, but
slightly on one side of the centre. And generally, excepting in the
parallelism of their sides, buildings seem placed with but slight regard
to neighboring ones.
</p>
<p>
For effect, the Persian architecture must have depended, firstly,
upon the harmony that is produced by the observance of regularity and
proportion; and, secondly, upon two main features of the style. These
were the grand sculptured staircases which formed the approaches to all
the principal buildings, and the vast groves of elegant pillars in and
about the great halls. The lesser buildings were probably ugly, except
in front. But such edifices as the Chehl Minar at Persepolis, and its
duplicate at Susa&mdash;where long vistas of columns met the eye on every
side, and the great central cluster was supported by lighter detached
groups, combining similarity of form with some variety of ornament,
where richly colored drapings contrasted with the cool gray stone of the
building, and a golden roof overhung a pavement of many hues&mdash;must
have been handsome, from whatever side they were contemplated, and for
general richness and harmony of effect may have compared favorably
with any edifices which, up to the time of their construction, had been
erected in any country or by any people. If it may seem to some that
they were wanting in grandeur, on account of their comparatively low
height&mdash;a height which, including that of the platform, was probably in
no case much more than a hundred feet&mdash;it must be remembered that the
buildings of Greece and (except the Pyramids) those of Egypt, had the
same defect, and that, until the constructive powers of the arch came to
be understood, it was almost impossible to erect a building that should
be at once lofty and elegant. Height, moreover, if the buildings are for
use, implies inconvenience, a waste of time and power being involved
in the ascent and descent of steps. The ancient architects, studying
utility more than effect, preferred spreading out their buildings
to piling them up, and rarely, unless in thickly-peopled towns, even
introduced a second story.
</p>
<p>
The spectator, however, was impressed with a sense of grandeur in
another way. The use of huge blocks of stone, not only in platforms,
but in the buildings themselves, in the shafts of pillars, the antae of
porticos, the jambs of doorways, occasionally in roofs, and perhaps in
epistylia, produced the same impression of power, and the same feeling
of personal insignificance in the beholder, which is commonly effected
by great size in the edifice, and particularly by height. The mechanical
skill required to transport and raise into place the largest of these
blocks must have been very considerable, and their employment causes not
merely a blind admiration of those who so built on the part of ignorant
persons, but a profound respect for them on the part of those who are by
their studies and tastes best qualified for pronouncing on the relative
and absolute merits of architectural masterpieces.
</p>
<p>
Among the less pleasing peculiarities of the Persian architecture may be
mentioned a general narrowness of doors in proportion to their height, a
want of passages, a thickness of walls, which is architecturally clumsy,
but which would have had certain advantages in such a climate, an
inclination to place the doors of rooms near one corner, an allowance of
two entrances into a great hall from under a single portico, a peculiar
position of propylaea, and the very large employment of pillars in
the interior of buildings. In many of these points, and also in the
architectural use which was made of sculpture, the style of building
resembled, to some extent, that of Assyria; the propylaea, however, were
less Assyrian than Egyptian; while in the main and best features of the
architecture, it was (so far as we can tell) original. The solid and
handsome stone platforms, the noble staircases, and the profusion of
light and elegant stone columns, which formed the true glory of
the architecture&mdash;being the features on which its effect chiefly
depended&mdash;have nowhere been discovered in Assyria; and all the
evidence is against their existence. The Arians found in Mesopotamia an
architecture of which the pillar was scarcely an element at all&mdash;which
was fragile and unenduring&mdash;and which depended for its effect on a
lavish display of partially colored sculpture and more richly tinted
enamelled brick. Instead of imitating this, they elaborated for
themselves, from the wooden buildings of their own mountain homes, a
style almost exactly the reverse of that with which their victories had
brought them into contact. Adopting, of main features, nothing but the
platform, they imparted even to this a new character, by substituting
in its construction the best for the worst of materials, and by further
giving to these stone structures a massive solidity, from the employment
of huge, blocks, which made them stand in the strongest possible
contrast to the frail and perishable mounds of Babylonia and Assyria.
Having secured in this way a firm and enduring basis, they proceeded to
erect upon it buildings where the perpendicular line was primary and the
horizontal secondary&mdash;buildings of almost, the same solid and massive
character as the platform itself&mdash;forests of light but strong columns,
supporting a wide-spreading roof, sometimes open to the air, sometimes
enclosed by walls, according as they were designed for summer or winter
use, or for greater or less privacy. To edifices of this character
elaborate ornamentation was unnecessary; for the beauty of the column is
such that nothing more is needed to set off a building. Sculpture
would thus be dispensed with, or reserved for mere occasional use, and
employed not so much on the palace itself as on its outer approaches;
while brick enamelling could well be rejected altogether, as too poor
and fragile a decoration for buildings of such strength and solidity.
</p>
<p>
The origination of this columnar architecture must be ascribed to the
Medes, who, dwelling in or near the more wooden parts of the Zagros
range, constructed, during the period of their empire, edifices of
considerable magnificence, whereof wooden pillars were the principal
feature, the courts being surrounded by colonnades, and the chief
buildings having porticos, the pillars in both cases being of wood. A
wooden roof rested on these supports, protected externally by plates of
metal. We do not know if the pillars had capitals, or if they supported
an entablature; but probability is in favor of both these arrangements
having existed. When the Persians succeeded the Medes in the
sovereignty of Western Asia, they found Arian architecture in this
condition. As stone, however, was the natural material of their country,
which is but scantily wooded and is particularly barren towards the edge
of the great plateau, where their chief towns were situated, and as
they had from the first a strong desire of fame and a love for the
substantial and the enduring, they almost immediately substituted for
the cedar and cypress pillars of the Medes, stone shafts, plain or
fluted, which they carried to a surprising height, and fixed with such
firmness that many of them have resisted the destructive powers of
time, of earthquakes, and of vandalism for more than three-and-twenty
centuries, and still stand erect and nearly as perfect as when they
received the last touch from the sculptor's hand more than 2000 years
ago. It is the glory of the Persians in art to have invented this style,
which they certainly did not learn from the Assyrians, and which
they can scarcely be supposed to have adopted from Egypt, where the
conception of the pillar and its ornamentation were wholly different.
We can scarcely doubt that Greece received from this quarter the impulse
which led to the substitution of the light and elegant forms which
distinguish the architecture of her best period from the rude and clumsy
work of the more ancient times.
</p>
<p>
Of the mimetic art of the Persians we do not possess any great amount,
or any great variety, of specimens. The existing remains consist of
reliefs, either executed on the natural rock or on large slabs of hewn
stone used in building, of impressions upon coins, and of a certain
number of intaglios cut upon gems. We possess no Persian statues, no
modelled figures, no metal castings, no carvings in ivory or in wood, no
enamellings, no pottery even. The excavations on Persian sites have been
singularly barren of those minor results which flowed so largely
from the Mosopotamian excavations, and have yielded no traces of the
furniture, domestic implements, or wall-ornamentation of the people;
have produced, in fact, no small objects at all, excepting a few
cylinders and some spear and arrow heads, thus throwing scarcely any
light on the taste or artistic genius of the people.
</p>
<p>
The nearest approach to statuary which we meet with among the Persian
remains are the figures of colossal bulls, set to guard portals,
or porticos, which are not indeed sculptures in the round, but are
specimens of exceedingly high relief, and which, being carved in front
as well as along the side, do not fall very far short of statues. Of
such figures, we find two varieties&mdash;one representing the real animal,
the other a monster with the body and legs of a bull, the head of a
man, and the wings of an eagle. There is considerable merit in both
representations. They are free from the defect of flatness, or want of
breadth in comparison with the length, which characterizes the similar
figures of Assyrian artists; and they are altogether grand, massive, and
imposing. The general proportions of the bulls are good, the limbs are
accurately drawn, the muscular development is well portrayed, and the
pose of the figure is majestic. Even the monstrous forms of human-headed
bulls have a certain air of quiet dignity, which is not without its
effect on the beholder; and, although implying no great artistic merit,
since they are little more than reproductions of Assyrian models,
indicate an appreciation of some of the best qualities of Assyrian
art&mdash;the combination of repose with strength, of great size with the
most careful finish, and of strangeness with the absence of any approach
to grotesqueness or absurdity. The other Persian reliefs may be divided
under four heads:
</p>
<p>
(1) Mythological representations of a man&mdash;the king apparently&mdash;engaged
in combat with a lion, a bull, or a monster; (2) Processions of guards,
courtiers, attendants, or tribute-bearers; (3) Representations of the
monarch walking, seated upon his throne, or employed in the act of
worship; and (4) Representations of lions and bulls, either singly or
engaged in combat.
</p>
<p>
On the jambs of doorways in three of the Persepolitan buildings, a human
figure, dressed in the Median robe, but with the sleeve thrown back from
the right arm, is represented in the act of killing either a lion, a
bull, or a grotesque monster. In every case the animal is rampant, and
assails his antagonist with three of his feet, while he stands on the
fourth. The lion and bull have nothing about them that is very peculiar;
but the monsters present most strange and unusual combinations. One
of them has the griffin head, which we have already seen in use in
the capitals of columns, a feathered crest and neck, a bird's wings,
a scorpion's tail, and legs terminating in the claws of an eagle. The
other has an eagle's head, ears like an ass, feathers on the neck, the
breast, and the back, with the body, legs, and tail of a lion. <a href="#image-0032">[PLATE
LV., Fig. 1.]</a> Figures of equal grotesqueness, some of which possess
certain resemblances to these, are common in the mythology of Assyria,
and have been already represented in these volumes; but the Persian
specimens are no servile imitations of these earlier forms. The idea of
the Assyrian artist has, indeed, been borrowed; but Persian fancy has
worked it out in its own way, adding, modifying, and subtracting in such
a manner as to give to the form produced a quite peculiar, and (so to
speak) native character.

<p>
Persian gems abound with monstrous forms, of equal, or even superior
grotesqueness. As the Gothic architects indulged their imagination
in the most wonderful combinations to represent evil spirits or the
varieties of vice and sensualism, so the Persian gem-engravers seem
to have allowed their fancy to run riot in the creation of monsters,
representative of the Powers of Darkness or of different kinds of evil,
The stones exhibit the king in conflict with a vast variety of monsters,
some nearly resembling the Persepolitan, while others have strange
shapes unseen elsewhere. Winged lions, with two tails and with the horns
of a ram or an antelope, sphinxes and griffins of half a dozen different
kinds, and various other nondescript creatures, appear upon the Persian
gems and cylinders, furnishing abundant evidence of the quaint and
prolific fancy of the designers.
</p>
<p>
The processional subjects represented by the Persian artists are of
three kinds. In the simplest and least interesting the royal guards, or
the officers of the court, are represented in one or more lines of very
similar figures, either moving in one direction, or standing in two
bodies, one facing the other, in the attitude of quiet expectation. In
these subjects there is a great sameness, and a very small amount of
merit. The proportion of the forms is, indeed, fairly good, the heads
and hands are well drawn, and there is some grace in certain of
the figures, but the general effect is tame and somewhat heavy; the
attitudes are stiff, and present little variety, while, nevertheless,
they are sometimes impossible; there is a monotonous repetition of
identically the same figure, which is tiresome, and a want of grouping
which is very inartistic. If Persia had produced nothing better than
this in sculpture, she would have had to be placed not only behind
Assyria, but behind Egypt, as far as the sculptor's art is concerned.
</p>
<p>
Processional scenes of a more attractive character are, however,
tolerably frequent. Some exhibit to us the royal purveyors arriving at
the palace with their train of attendants, and bringing with them the
provisions required for the table of the monarch. Here we have some
varieties of costume which are curious, and some representations
of Persian utensils, which are not without a certain interest.
Occasionally, too, we are presented with animal forms, as kids, which
have considerable merit.
</p>
<p>
But by far the most interesting of the processional scenes, are those
which represent the conquered nations bringing to the monarch those
precious products of their several countries which the Lord of Asia
expected to receive annually, as a sort of free gift from his subjects,
in addition to the fixed tribute which was exacted from them. Here we
have a wonderful variety of costume and equipment, a happy admixture of
animal with human forms, horses, asses, chariots, sheep, cattle, camels,
interspersed among men, and the whole divided into groups by means of
cypress-trees, which break the series into portions, and allow the eye
to rest in succession upon a number of distinct pictures. Processions of
this kind occurred on several of the Persepolitan staircases; but by far
the most elaborate and complete is that on the grand steps in front of
the Chehl Minar, or Great Hall of Audience, where we see above twenty
such groups of figures, each with it own peculiar features, and all
finished with the utmost care and delicacy. The illustration <a href="#image-0032">[PLATE LV.,
Fig. 2]</a>, which is taken from a photograph, will give a tolerable idea
of the general character of this relief; it shows the greater portion of
six groups, whereof two are much injured by the fall of the parapet-wall
on which they were represented, while the remaining four are in good
preservation. It will be noticed that the animal forms&mdash;the Bactrian
camel and the humped ox&mdash;are superior to the human, and have
considerable positive merit as works of art. This relative superiority
is observable throughout the entire series, which contains, besides
several horses (some of which have been already represented in these
volumes), a lioness, an excellent figure of the wild ass, and two
tolerably well-drawn sheep. <a href="#image-0033">[PLATE LVI., Fig. 2 and 3.]</a>

<p>
The representations of the monarch upon the reliefs are of three kinds.
In the simplest, he is on foot, attended by the parasol-bearer and
the napkin-bearer, or by the latter only, apparently in the act of
proceeding from one part of the palace to another. In the more elaborate
he is either seated on an elevated throne, which is generally supported
by numerous caryatid figures, or he stands on a platform similarly
upheld, in the act of worship before an altar. This latter is the
universal representation upon tombs, while the throne scenes are
reserved for palaces. In both representations the supporting figures
are numerous; and it is here chiefly that we notice varieties of
physiognomy, which are evidently intended to recall the differences
in the physical type of the several races by which the Empire was
inhabited. In one case, we have a negro very well portrayed; in others
we trace the features of Scyths or Tatars. It is manifest that the
artist has not been content to mark the nationality of the different
figures by costume alone, but has aimed at reproducing upon the stone
the physiognomic peculiarities of each race.
</p>
<p>
The purely animal representations which the bas-reliefs bring before us
are few in number, and have little variety of type. The most curious and
the most artistic is one which is several times repeated at Persepolis,
where it forms the usual ornamentation of the triangular spaces on the
facades of stairs. This is a representation of a combat between a lion
and a bull, or (perhaps, we should rather say) a representation of a
lion seizing and devouring a bull; for the latter animal is evidently
powerless to offer any resistance to the fierce beast which has sprung
upon him from behind, and has fixed both fangs and claws in his body.
<a href="#image-0033">[PLATE LVI., Fig. 4.]</a> In his agony the bull rears up his fore-parts, and
turns his head feebly towards his assailant, whose strong limbs and jaws
have too firm a hold to be dislodged by such struggles as his unhappy
victim is capable of making. In no Assyrian drawing is the massiveness
and strength of the king of beasts more powerfully rendered than in
this favorite group, which the Persian sculptors repeated without the
slightest change from generation to generation. The contour of the lion,
his vast muscular development, and his fierce countenance are really
admirable, and the bold presentation of the face in full, instead of in
profile, is beyond the ordinary powers of Oriental artists.
</p>
<p>
Drawings of bulls and lions in rows, where each animal is the exact
counterpart of all the others, are found upon the friezes of some of the
tombs, and upon the representations of canopies over the royal throne.
These drawings are fairly spirited, but have not any extraordinary
merit. They reproduce forms well known in Assyria. A figure of a sitting
lion seems also to have been introduced occasionally on the facades of
staircases, occurring in the central compartment of the parapet-wall at
top. These figures, in no case, remain complete; but enough is left
to show distinctly what the attitude was, and this appears not to have
resembled very closely any common Assyrian type. <a href="#image-0034">[PLATE LVII., Fig. 1.]</a>

<p>
The Persian gem-engravings have considerable merit, and need not fear a
comparison with those of any other Oriental nation. They occur upon
hard stones of many different kinds, as cornelian, onyx, rock-crystal,
sapphirine, sardonyx, chalcedony, etc., and are executed for the most
part with great skill and delicacy. The designs which they embody are in
general of a mythological character; but sometimes scenes of real life
occur upon them, and then the drawing is often good, and almost
always spirited. In proof of this, the reader may be referred to the
hunting-scenes already given, which are derived wholly from this source,
as well as to the gems figured <a href="#image-0033">[PLATE LVI., Fig. 3]</a>, one of which is
certainly, and the other almost certainly, of Persian workmanship. In
the former we see the king, not struggling with a mythological lion but
engaged apparently in the actual chase of the king of beasts Two lions
have been roused from their lairs, and the monarch hastily places an
arrow on the string, anxious to despatch one of his foes before the
other can come to close quarters The eagerness of the hunter and the
spirit and boldness of the animals are well represented. In the other
gem, while there is less of artistic excellence, we have a scene of
peculiar interest placed before us. A combat between two Persians and
two Cythians seems to be represented. The latter marked by their peaked
cap and their loose trousers, fight with the bow and the battle-axe,
the former with the bow and the sword One Scyth is receiving his
death-wound, the other is about to let loose a shaft, but seems at the
same time half inclined to fly The steady confidence of the warriors
on the one side contrasts well with the timidity and hesitancy of their
weaker and smaller rivals. <a href="#image-0034">[PLATE LVII., Fig. 3.]</a>
</p>
<p>
The vegetable forms represented on the gems are sometimes graceful
and pleasing. This is especially the case with palm-trees, a favorite
subject of the artists, who delineated with remarkable success the
feathery leaves, the pendant fruit and the rough bark of the
stem. <a href="#image-0035">[PLATE LVIII., Fig 1.]</a> The lion-hunter represented on the
signet-cylinder of Darius Hystaspis takes place in a palm-grove, and
furnishes the accompanying example of this form of vegetable life.

<p>
One gem, ascribed on somewhat doubtful grounds to the Persians of
Achaemenian times, contains what appears to be a portrait. It is thought
to be the bust of a satrap of Salamis in Cyprus, and is very carefully
executed. If really of Persian workmanship, it would indicate a
considerable advance in the power of representing the human countenance
between the time of Darius Hystaspis and that of Alexander <a href="#image-0034">[PLATE LVII.
Fig. 2.]</a>
</p>
<p>
Persian coins are of three principal types. The earliest have on the one
side the figure of a monarch bearing the diadem and armed with the bow
and javelin, while on the other there is an irregular indentation of the
same nature with the <i>quadratum incusum</i> of the Greeks. This rude form
is replaced in later times by a second design, which is sometimes a
horseman, sometimes the forepart of a ship, sometimes the king drawing
an an arrow from his quiver. Another type exhibits on the obverse the
monarch in combat with a lion while the reverse shows a galley, or a
towered and battlemented city with two lions standing below it, back to
back. The third common type has on the obverse the king in his chariot,
with his charioteer in front of him, and (generally) an attendant
carrying a fly-chaser behind. The reverse has either the trireme or the
battlemented city. A specimen of each type is given. <a href="#image-0034">[PLATE LVII., Fig.
4.]</a>
</p>
<p>
The artistic merit of these medals is not great. The relief is low,
and the drawing generally somewhat rude. The head of the monarch in the
early coins is greatly too large. The animal forms are, however, much
superior to the human, and the horses which draw the royal chariot, the
lions placed below the battlemented city, and the bulls which are found
occasionally in the same position, must be pronounced truthful and
spirited.
</p>
<p>
Of the Persian taste in furniture, utensils, personal ornaments and the
like, we need say but little. The throne and footstool of the monarch
are the only pieces of furniture represented in the sculptures,
and these, though sufficiently elegant in their forms, are not very
remarkable. Costliness of material seems to have been more prized than
beauty of shape; and variety appears to have been carefully eschewed,
one single uniform type of each article occurring in all the
representations. The utensils represented are likewise few in number,
and limited to certain constantly repeated forms. The most elaborate is
the censer, which has been already given. With this is usually seen
a sort of pail or basket, shaped like a lady's reticule, in which the
aromatic gums for burning were probably kept. <a href="#image-0035">[PLATE LVIII., Fig. 5.]</a>
A covered dish, and a goblet with an inverted saucer over it, are also
forms of frequent occurrence in the hands of the royal attendants; and
the tribute-bearers frequently carry, among their other offerings, bowls
or basons, which, though not of Persian manufacture, were no doubt left
at the court, and took their place among the utensils of the palace.
<a href="#image-0035">[PLATE LVIII., Figs. 2 and 3.]</a>
</p>
<p>
In the matter of personal ornaments the taste of the Persians seems to
have been peculiarly simple. Earrings were commonly plain rings of gold;
bracelets mere bands of the same metal. Collars were circlets of gold
twisted in a very inartificial fashion. There was nothing artistic
in the sheaths or hilts of swords, though spear-shafts were sometimes
adorned with the representation of an apple or a pomegranate. Dresses
seem not to have been often patterned, but to have depended generally
for their effect on make and color. In all these respects we observe
a remarkable contrast between the Arian and the Semitic races,
extreme simplicity characterizing the one, while the most elaborate
ornamentation was affected by the other.
</p>
<p>
Persia was not celebrated in antiquity for the production of any special
fabrics. The arts of weaving and dyeing were undoubtedly practised in
the dominant country, as well as in most of the subject provinces, and
the Persian dyes seem even to have had a certain reputation; but none
of the productions of their looms acquired a name among foreign nations.
Their skill, indeed, in the mechanical arts generally was, it is
probable, not more than moderate. It was their boast that they were
soldiers, and had won a position by their good swords which gave them
the command of all that was most exquisite and admirable, whether in the
natural world or among the products of human industry. So long as the
carpets of Babylon and Sardis, the shawls of Kashmir and India, the fine
linen of Borsippa and Egypt, the ornamental metal-work of Greece,
the coverlets of Damascus, the muslins of Babylonia, the multiform
manufactures of the Phoenician towns, poured continually into Persia
Proper in the way of tribute, gifts, or merchandise, it was needless for
the native population to engage largely in industrial enterprise.
</p>
<p>
To science the ancient Persians contributed absolutely nothing. The
genius of the nation was adverse to that patient study and those
laborious investigations from which alone scientific progress ensues.
Too light and frivolous, too vivacious, too sensuous for such pursuits,
they left them to the patient Babylonians, and the thoughtful, many-sided
Greeks. The schools of Orchoe, Borsippa, and Miletus flourished under
their sway, but without provoking their emulation, possibly without so
much as attracting their attention. From first to last, from the dawn
to the final close of their power, they abstained wholly from scientific
studies. It would seem that they thought it enough to place before the
world, as signs of their intellectual vigor, the fabric of their Empire
and the buildings of Susa and Persepolis.

<h2>
    CHAPTER VI. RELIGION.
</h2>
<p>
The original form of the Persian religion has been already described
under the head of the third or Median monarchy. It was identical with
the religion of the Medes in its early shape, consisting mainly in
the worship of Ahura-Mazda, the acknowledgment of a principle of
evil&mdash;Angro-Mainyus, and obedience to the precepts of Zoroaster. When
the Medes, on establishing a wide-spread Empire, chiefly over races by
whom Magism had been long professed, allowed the creed of their subjects
to corrupt their own belief, accepted the Magi for their priests, and
formed the mixed religious system of which an account has been given in
the second volume of this work, the Persians in their wilder country,
less exposed to corrupting influences, maintained their original faith
in undiminished purity, and continued faithful to their primitive
traditions. The political dependence of their country upon Media during
the period of the Median sway made no difference in this respect; for
the Medes were tolerant, and did not seek to interfere with the creed of
their subjects. The simple Zoroastrian belief and worship, overlaid by
Magism in the now luxurious Media, found a refuge in the rugged Persian
uplands, among the hardy shepherds and cultivators of that unattractive
region, was professed by the early Achaemenian princes, and generally
acquiesced in by the people.
</p>
<p>
The main feature of the religion daring this first period was the
acknowledgment and the worship of a single supreme God&mdash;"the Lord God of
Heaven"&mdash;"the giver (i.e. maker) of heaven and earth"&mdash;the disposer of
thrones, the dispenser of happiness. The foremost place in inscriptions
and decrees was assigned, almost universally, to the "great god,
Ormazd." Every king, of whom we have an inscription more than two lines
in length, speaks of Ormazd as his upholder; and the early monarchs
mention by name no other god. All rule "by the grace of Ormazd." From
Ormazd come victory, conquest, safety, prosperity, blessings of every
kind. The "law of Ormazd" is the rule of life. The protection of Ormazd
is the one priceless blessing for which prayer is perpetually offered.
</p>
<p>
While, however, Ormazd holds this exalted and unapproachable position,
there is still an acknowledgment made, in a general way, of "other
gods." Ormazd is "the greatest of the gods" (<i>mathista baganam</i>). It is
a usual prayer to ask for the protection of Ormazd, together with that
of these lesser powers (<i>hada bagaibish</i>). Sometimes the phrase is
varied, and the petition is for the special protection of a certain
class of Deities&mdash;the <i>Dii familiares</i>&mdash;or "deities who guard the
house."
</p>
<p>
The worship of Mithra, or the Sun, does not appear in the inscriptions
until the reign of Artaxerxes Mnemon, the victor of Cunaxa. It is,
however, impossible to doubt that it was a portion of the Persian
religion, at least as early as the date of Herodotus. Probably it
belongs, in a certain sense, to primitive Zoroastrianism, but was kept
in the background during the early period, when a less materialistic
worship prevailed than suited the temper of later times.
</p>
<p>
Nor can it be doubted that the Persians held during this early period
that Dualistic belief which has been the distinguishing feature of
Zoroastrianism from a time long anterior to the commencement of the
Median Empire down to the present day. It was not to be expected
that this belief would show itself in the inscriptions, unless in the
faintest manner; and it can therefore excite no surprise that they are
silent, or all but silent, on the point in question. Nor need we wonder
that this portion of their creed was not divulged by the Persians to
Herodotus or to Xenophon, since it is exactly the sort of subject on
which reticence was natural and might have been anticipated. Neither the
lively Halicarnassian, nor the pleasant but somewhat shallow Athenian,
had the gift of penetrating very deeply into the inner mind of a
foreign people; added to which, it is to be remembered that they were
unacquainted with Persia Proper, and drew their knowledge of Persian
opinions and customs either from hearsay or from the creed and practices
of the probably mixed garrisons which held Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt.
</p>
<p>
Persian worship, in these early times, was doubtless that enjoined by
the Zendavesta, comprising prayer and thanksgiving to Ormazd and the
good spirits of his creation, the recitation of Gathas or hymns, the
performance of sacrifice, and participation in the Soma ceremony.
Worship seems to have taken place in temples, which are mentioned
(according to the belief of most cuneiform scholars) in the Behistun
inscription. Of the character of these buildings we can say nothing.
It has been thought that those two massive square towers so similar in
construction, which exist in a more or less ruined condition at Murgab
and Nakhsh-i-Rustam, are Persian temples of the early period, built to
contain an altar on which the priests offered victims. But the absence
of any trace of an altar from both, the total want of religious emblems,
and the extremely small size of the single apartment which each tower
contains, make strongly against the temple theory; not to mention that a
much more probable use may be suggested for the buildings.
</p>
<p>
With respect to the altars upon which sacrifice was offered, we are not
left wholly without evidence. The Persian monarchs of the early period,
including Darius Hystaspis, represented themselves on their tombs in the
act of worship. Before them, at the distance of a few feet, stands an
altar, elevated on three steps, and crowned with the sacrificial fire.
Its form is square, and its only ornaments are a sunken squared recess,
and a strongly projecting cornice at top. The height of the altar,
including the steps, was apparently about four and a half feet. <a href="#image-0035">[PLATE
LVIII., Fig. 4.]</a>
</p>
<p>
The Persians' favorite victim was the horse; but they likewise
sacrificed cattle, sheep, and goats. Human sacrifices seem to have been
almost, if not altogether, unknown to them, and were certainly alien to
the entire spirit of the Zoroastrian system. The flesh of the victim was
probably merely shown to the sacred fire, after which it was eaten by
the priests, the sacrificer, and those whom the latter associated with
himself in the ceremony.
</p>
<p>
The spirit of the Zendavesta is wholly averse to idolatry, and we may
fully accept the statement of Herodotus that images of the gods were
entirely unknown to the Persians. Still, they did not deny themselves a
certain use of symbolic representations of their deities, nor did
they even scruple to adopt from idolatrous nations the forms of their
religious symbolism. The winged circle, with or without the addition of
a human figure, which was in Assyria the emblem of the chief Assyrian
deity, Asshur, became with the Persians the ordinary representation of
the Supreme God, Ormazd, and, as such, was placed in most conspicuous
positions on their rock tombs and on their buildings. <a href="#image-0035">[PLATE LVIII.,
Fig. 7.]</a> Nor was the general idea only of the emblem adopted, but all
the details of the Assyrian model were followed, with one exception. The
human figure of the Assyrian original wore the close-fitting tunic, with
short sleeves, which was the ordinary costume in Assyria, and had on
its head the horned cap which marked a god or a genius. In the Persian
counterpart this costume was exchanged for the Median robe, and a tiara,
which was sometimes that proper to the king,23 sometimes that worn with
the Median robe by court officers. <a href="#image-0035">[PLATE LVIII., Fig. 7.]</a>
</p>
<p>
Mithra, or the Sun, is represented in Persian sculptures by a disk or
orb, which is not four-rayed like the Assyrian, but perfectly plain
and simple. In sculptures where the emblems of Ormazd and Mithra occur
together, the position of the former is central, that of the latter
towards the right hand of the tablet. The solar emblem is universal on
sculptured tombs, but is otherwise of rare occurrence.
</p>
<p>
Spirits of good and evil, the Ahuras and Devas of the mythology, were
represented by the Persians under human, animal, or monstrous forms.
There can be little doubt that it is a good genius&mdash;perhaps the
"well-formed, swift, tall Serosh"&mdash;who appears on one of the square
pillars set up by Cyrus at Pasargadae. This figure is that of a colossal
man, from whose shoulders issue four wings, two of which spread upwards
above his head, while the other two droop and reach nearly to his feet.
<a href="#image-0036">[PLATE LIX.]</a> It stands erect, in profile, with both arms raised and the
hands open. The costume of the figure is remarkable. It consists of a
long fringed robe reaching from the neck to the ankles&mdash;apparently of
a stiff material, which conceals the form&mdash;and of a very singular
head-dress. This is a striped cap, closely fitting the head,
overshadowed by an elaborate ornament, of a character purely Egyptian.
First there rise from the top of the cap two twisted horns, which,
spreading right and left, become a sort of basis for the other forms to
rest upon. These consist of two grotesque human-headed figures, one at
either side, and of a complex triple ornament between them, clumsily
imitated from a far more elegant Egyptian model. <a href="#image-0038">[PLATE LX., Fig. 1.]</a>
</p>
<a name="image-0036"><!--IMG--></a>
<center>
<img src="images/plate059.jpg" height="976" width="591"
alt="Plate Lix. 
">
</center>

<p>
The winged human-headed bulls, which the Persians adopted from the
Assyrians, with very slight modifications, were also, it is probable,
regarded as emblems of some god or good genius. They would scarcely
otherwise have been represented on Persian cylinders as upholding the
emblem of Ormazd in the same way that human-headed bulls uphold the
similar emblem of Asshur on Assyrian cylinders. <a href="#image-0038">[PLATE LX., Fig. 2.]</a>
Their position, too, at Persepolis, where they kept watch over the
entrance to the palace, accords with the notion that they represented
guardian spirits, objects of the favorable regard of the Persians. Yet
this view is not wholly free from difficulty. The bull appears in
the bas-reliefs of Persepolis among the evil, or at any rate hostile,
powers, which the king combats and slays; and though in these
representations the animal is not winged or human-headed, yet on some
cylinders apparently Persian, the monarch contends with bulls of exactly
the same type as that which is assigned in other cylinders to the
upholders of Ormazd. It would seem therefore that in this case the
symbolism was less simple than usual, the bull in certain combinations
and positions representing a god or a good spirit, while in others he
was the type of a deva or evil genius.

</center>
<br />

<p>
The most common representatives of the Evil Powers of the mythology
were lions, winged or unwinged, and monsters of several different
descriptions. At Persepolis the lions which the king stabs or strangles
are of the natural shape, and this type is found also upon gems and
cylinders; but on these last the king's antagonist is often a winged,
while sometimes he is a winged and horned, lion. <a href="#image-0038">[PLATE LX., Fig. 3.]</a>
The monsters are of two principal types. In both the forms of a bird and
a beast are commingled; but in the one the bird, and in the other the
beast predominates. Specimens are given <a href="#image-0038">[PLATE LX., Fig. 4]</a> taken from
Persian gems and cylinders.
</p>
<p>
Such seems to have been, in outline, the purer and more ancient form
of the Persian religion. During its continuance a fierce iconoclastic
spirit animated the princes of the Empire, who took every opportunity of
showing their hatred and contempt for the idolatries of the neighboring
nations, burning temples, confiscating or destroying images, scourging
or slaying idolatrous priests, putting a stop to festivals,
disturbing tombs, smiting with the sword animals believed to be divine
incarnations. Within their own dominions the fear of stirring up
religious wars compelled them to be moderately tolerant, unless it
were after rebellion, when a province lay at their mercy; but when they
invaded foreign countries, they were wont to exhibit in the most open
and striking way their aversion to materialistic religions. In Greece,
during the great invasion, they burned every temple that they came near;
in Egypt, on their first attack, they outraged every religious feeling
of the people.
</p>
<p>
It was during this time of comparative purity, when the anti-idolatrous
spirit was in full force, that a religious sympathy seems to have drawn
together the two nations of the Persians and the Jews. Cyrus evidently
identified Jehovah with Ormazd, and, accepting as a divine command the
prophecy of Isaiah, undertook to rebuild their temple for a people who,
like his own, allowed no image of God to defile the sanctuary. Darius,
similarly, encouraged the completion of the work, after it had been
interrupted by the troubles which followed the death of Cambyses. The
foundation was thus laid for that friendly intimacy between the two
peoples, of which we have abundant evidence in the books of Ezra,
Nehemiah, and Esther, a friendly intimacy which caused the Jews to
continue faithful to Persia to the last, and to brave the conqueror
of Issus rather than desert masters who had shown them kindness and
sympathy.
</p>
<p>
The first trace that we have of a corrupting influence being brought
to bear on the Persian religion is connected with the history of the
pseudo-Smerdis. According to Herodotus, Cambyses, when he set out on
his Egyptian expedition, left a Magus, Patizeithes, at the capital, as
comptroller of the royal household. The conferring of an office of such
importance on the priest of an alien religion is the earliest indication
which we have of a diminution of zeal for their ancestral creed on the
part of the Achaemenian kings, and the earliest historical proof of the
existence of Magism beyond the limits of Media. Magism was really, it
is probable, an older creed than Zoroastrianism in the country where the
Persians were settled; but it now, for the first time since the Persian
conquest, began to show itself, to thrust itself into high places, and
to attract general notice. From being the religion of the old Scythic
tribes whom the Persians had conquered and whom they held in subjection,
it had passed into being the religion of great numbers of the Persians
themselves. The same causes which had corrupted Zoroastrianism in Media
soon after the establishment of the Empire, worked also, though more
slowly, in Persia, and a large section of the nation was probably weaned
from its own belief, and won over to Magism, before Cambyses went
into Egypt. His prolonged absence in that country brought matters to
a crisis. The Magi took advantage of it to attempt a substitution
of Magism for Zoroastrianism as the religion of the state. When
this attempt failed, there was no doubt a reaction for a time, and
Zoroastrianism thought itself triumphant. But a foe is generally most
dangerous when he is despised. Magism, repulsed in its attempt to oust
the rival religion, derived wisdom from the lesson, and thenceforth set
itself to sap the fortress which it could not storm. Little by little
it crept into favor, mingling itself with the old Arian creed, not
displacing it, but only adding to it. In the later Persian system the
Dualism of Zoroaster and the Magian elemental worship were jointly
professed&mdash;the Magi were accepted as the national priests&mdash;the rights
and ceremonies of the two religions were united&mdash;a syncretism not
unusual in the ancient world blended into one two creeds originally
quite separate and distinct, but in few respects antagonistic&mdash;and the
name of Zoroaster being still fondly cherished in the memory of the
nation, while in their practical religion Magian rites predominated,
the mixed religion acquired the name, by which it was known to the later
Greeks, of "the Magism of Zoroaster."
</p>
<p>
The Magian rites have been described in the chapter on the Median
Religion. Their leading feature was the fire-worship, which is still
cherished among those descendants of the ancient Persians who did
not submit to the religion of Islam. On lofty spots in the high
mountain-chain which traversed both Media and Persia, fire-altars were
erected, on which burnt a perpetual flame, watched constantly lest it
should expire, and believed to have been kindled from heaven. Over the
altar in most instances a shrine or temple was built; and on these
spots day after day the Magi chanted their incantations, displayed
their barsoms or divining-rods, and performed their choicest ceremonies.
Victims were not offered on these fire-altars. When a sacrifice took
place, a fire was laid hard-by with logs of dry wood, stript of their
bark, and this was lighted from the flame which burned on the altar.
On the fire thus kindled was consumed a small part of the fat of the
victim; but the rest was cut into joints, boiled, and eaten or sold
by the worshipper. The true offering, which the god accepted, was,
according to the Magi, the soul of the animal.
</p>
<p>
If human victims were ever really offered by the Persians as sacrifices,
it is to Magian influence that the introduction of this horrid practice
must be attributed, since it is utterly opposed to the whole spirit of
Zoroaster's teaching. An instance of the practice is first reported in
the reign of Xerxes, when Magism, which had been sternly repressed by
Darius Hystaspis, began once more to lift its head, crept into favor
at Court, and obtained a status which it never afterwards forfeited.
According to Herodotus, the Persians, on their march into Greece,
sacrificed, at Ennea Hodoi on the Strymon river, nine youths and nine
maidens of the country, by burying them alive. Herodotus seems to have
viewed the act as done in propitiation of a god resembling the Grecian
Pluto; but it is not at all certain that he interpreted it correctly.
Possibly he mistook a vengeance for a religious ceremony. The Brygi, who
dwelt at this time in the vicinity of Ennea Hodoi, had given Mardonius
a severe defeat on a former occasion; and the Persians were apt to
treasure up such wrongs, and visit them, when occasion offered, with
extreme severity.
</p>
<p>
When the Persians had once yielded to the syncretic spirit so far as to
unite the Magian tenets and practices with their primitive belief, they
were naturally led on to adopt into their system such portions of the
other religions, with which they were brought into close contact, as
possessed an attraction for them. Before the date of Herodotus they had
borrowed from the Babylonians the worship of a Nature-Goddess, whom the
Greeks identified at one time with Aphrodite, at another with Artemis,
at another (probably) with Here, and had thus made a compromise with one
of the grossest of the idolatries which, theoretically, they despised
and detested. The Babylonian Venus, called in the original dialect of
her native country Nana, was taken into the Pantheon of the Persians,
under the name of Nansea, Anaea, Anaitis, or Tanata, and became in a
little while one of the principal objects of Persian worship. At first
idolatry, in the literal sense, was avoided; but Artaxerxes Mnemon, the
conqueror of Cunaxa, an ardent devotee of the goddess, not content with
the mutilated worship which he found established, resolved to show his
zeal by introducing into all the chief cities of the Empire the image
of his patroness. At Susa, at Persepolis, at Babylon, at Ecbatana, at
Damascus, at Sardis, at Bactra, images of Anaitis were set up by his
authority for the adoration of worshippers. It is to be feared that at
this time, if not before, the lascivious rites were also adopted, which
throughout the East constituted the chief attraction of the cult of
Venus.
</p>
<p>
With the idolatry thus introduced, another came soon to be joined.
Mithra, so long an object of reverence, if not of actual worship, to
the Zoroastrians, was in the reign of Artaxerxes Mnemon, honored, like
Anaitis, with a statue, and advanced into the foremost rank of deities.
The exact form which the image took is uncertain; but probability is in
favor of the well-known type of a human figure slaying a prostrate bull,
which was to the Greeks and Romans the essential symbol of the Mithraic
worship. The intention of this oft-repeated group has been well
explained by Hyde, who regards it as a representation of the Sun
quitting the constellation of Taurus, the time when in the East his
fructifying power is the greatest. The specimens which we possess of
this group belong to classical art and to times later than Alexander;
but we can scarcely suppose the idea to have been Occidental. The
Western artists would naturally adopt the symbolism of those from whom
they took the rites, merely modifying its expression in accordance with
their own aesthetic notions.
</p>
<p>
Towards the close of the Empire two other gods emerged from the
obscurity in which the lower deities of the Zoroastrian system were
shrouded during the earlier and purer period. Vohu-manu, or Bah-man,
and Amerdat, or Amendat, two of the councillors of Ormazd, became the
objects of a worship, which was clearly of an idolatrous character.
Shrines were built in their honor, and were frequented by companies
of Magi, who chanted their incantations, and performed their rites
of divination in these new edifices as willingly as in the old
Fire-temples. The image of Bah-man was of wood, and was borne in
procession on certain occasions.
</p>
<p>
Thus as time went on, the Persian religion continually assimilated
itself more and more to the forms of belief and worship which prevailed
in the neighboring parts of Asia. Idolatries of several kinds came
into vogue, some adopted from abroad, others developed out of their
own system. Temples, some of which had a character of extraordinary
magnificence, were erected to the honor of various gods; and the
degenerate descendants of pure Zoroastrian spiritualists bowed down to
images, and entangled themselves in the meshes of a sensualistic and
most debasing Nature-worship. Still, amid whatsoever corruptions, the
Dualistic faith was maintained. The supremacy of Ormazd was from first
to last admitted. Ahriman retained from first to last the same character
and position, neither rising into an object of worship, nor sinking into
a mere personification of evil. The inquiries which Aristotle caused to
be made, towards the very close of the Empire, into the true nature of
the Persian Religion, showed him Ormazd and Ahriman still recognized
as Principles, still standing in the same hostile and antithetical
attitude, one towards the other, which they occupied when the first
Fargard of the Vendidad was written, long anterior to the rise of the
Persian Power.
