    <h2>
      PREFACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Histories of Phoenicia or of the Phoenicians were written towards the
      middle of the present century by Movers and Kenrick. The elaborate work of
      the former writer<a href="#linknote-01" name="linknoteref-01"
       id="linknoteref-01">01</a> collected into five moderate-sized volumes all
      the notices that classical antiquity had preserved of the Religion,
      History, Commerce, Art, &amp;c., of this celebrated and interesting
      nation. Kenrick, making a free use of the stores of knowledge thus
      accumulated, added to them much information derived from modern research,
      and was content to give to the world in a single volume of small size,<a
      href="#linknote-02" name="linknoteref-02" id="linknoteref-02">02</a> very
      scantily illustrated, the ascertained results of criticism and inquiry on
      the subject of the Phoenicians up to his own day. Forty-four years have
      since elapsed; and in the course of them large additions have been made to
      certain branches of the inquiry, while others have remained very much as
      they were before. Travellers, like Robinson, Walpole, Tristram, Renan, and
      Lortet, have thrown great additional light on the geography, geology,
      fauna, and flora of the country. Excavators, like Renan and the two Di
      Cesnolas, have caused the soil to yield up most valuable remains bearing
      upon the architecture, the art, the industrial pursuits, and the manners
      and customs of the people. Antiquaries, like M. Clermont-Ganneau and MM.
      Perrot and Chipiez, have subjected the remains to careful examination and
      criticism, and have definitively fixed the character of Phoenician Art,
      and its position in the history of artistic effort. Researches are still
      being carried on, both in Phoenicia Proper and in the Phoenician
      dependency of Cyprus, which are likely still further to enlarge our
      knowledge with respect to Phoenician Art and Archæology; but it is not
      probable that they will affect seriously the verdict already delivered by
      competent judges on those subjects. The time therefore appeared to the
      author to have come when, after nearly half a century of silence, the
      history of the people might appropriately be rewritten. The subject had
      long engaged his thoughts, closely connected as it is with the histories
      of Egypt, and of the &ldquo;Great Oriental Monarchies,&rdquo; which for thirty years
      have been to him special objects of study; and a work embodying the chief
      results of the recent investigations seemed to him a not unsuitable
      termination to the historical efforts which his resignation of the
      Professorship of Ancient History at Oxford, and his entrance upon a new
      sphere of labour, bring naturally to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      The author wishes to express his vast obligations to MM. Perrot and
      Chipiez for the invaluable assistance which he has derived from their
      great work,<a href="#linknote-03" name="linknoteref-03" id="linknoteref-03">03</a>
      and to their publishers, the MM. Hachette, for their liberality in
      allowing him the use of so large a number of MM. Perrot and Chipiez&rsquo;
      Illustrations. He is also much beholden to the same gentlemen for the use
      of charts and drawings originally published in the &ldquo;Géographie
      Universelle.&rdquo; Other works from which he has drawn either materials or
      illustrations, or both, are (besides Movers&rsquo; and Kenrick&rsquo;s) M. Ernest
      Renan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mission de Phénicie,&rdquo; General Di Cesnola&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cyprus,&rdquo; A. Di
      Cesnola&rsquo;s &ldquo;Salaminia,&rdquo; M. Ceccaldi&rsquo;s &ldquo;Monuments Antiques de Cypre,&rdquo; M.
      Daux&rsquo;s &ldquo;Recherches sur les Emporia Phéniciens,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Corpus Inscriptionum
      Semiticarum,&rdquo; M. Clermont-Ganneau&rsquo;s &ldquo;Imagerie Phénicienne,&rdquo; Mr. Davis&rsquo;s
      &ldquo;Carthage and her Remains,&rdquo; Gesenius&rsquo;s &ldquo;Scripturæ Linguæque Phoeniciæ
      Monumenta,&rdquo; Lortet&rsquo;s &ldquo;La Syrie d&rsquo;aujourd&rsquo;hui,&rdquo; Serra di Falco&rsquo;s &ldquo;Antichità
      della Sicilia,&rdquo; Walpole&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ansayrii,&rdquo; and Canon Tristram&rsquo;s &ldquo;Land of
      Israel.&rdquo; The difficulty has been to select from these copious stores the
      most salient and noteworthy facts, and to marshal them in such a form as
      would make them readily intelligible to the ordinary English reader. How
      far he has succeeded in doing this he must leave the public to judge. In
      making his bow to them as a &ldquo;Reader&rdquo; and Writer &ldquo;of Histories,"<a
      href="#linknote-04" name="linknoteref-04" id="linknoteref-04">04</a> he
      has to thank them for a degree of favour which has given a ready sale to
      all his previous works, and has carried some of them through several
      editions.

</pre>
    <p>
      Phoenicé, or Phoenicia, was the name originally given by the Greeks&mdash;and
      afterwards adopted from them by the Romans&mdash;to the coast region of
      the Mediterranean, where it faces the west between the thirty-second and
      the thirty-sixth parallels. Here, it would seem, in their early voyagings,
      the Pre-Homeric Greeks first came upon a land where the palm-tree was not
      only indigenous, but formed a leading and striking characteristic,
      everywhere along the low sandy shore lifting its tuft of feathery leaves
      into the bright blue sky, high above the undergrowth of fig, and
      pomegranate, and alive. Hence they called the tract Phoenicia, or &ldquo;the
      Land of Palms;&rdquo; and the people who inhabited it the Phoenicians, or &ldquo;the
      Palm-tree people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The term was from the first applied with a good deal of vagueness. It was
      probably originally given to the region opposite Cyprus, from Gabala in
      the north&mdash;now Jebili&mdash;to Antaradus (Tortosa) and Marathus
      (Amrith) towards the south, where the palm-tree was first seen growing in
      rich abundance. The palm is the numismatic emblem of Aradus,<a
      href="#linknote-11" name="linknoteref-11" id="linknoteref-11">11</a> and
      though not now very frequent in the region which Strabo calls &ldquo;the Aradian
      coast-tract,"<a href="#linknote-12" name="linknoteref-12"
       id="linknoteref-12">12</a> must anciently have been among its chief
      ornaments. As the Grecian knowledge of the coast extended southward, and a
      richer and still richer growth of the palm was continually noticed, almost
      every town and every village being embosomed in a circle of palm groves,
      the name extended itself until it reached as far south at any rate as
      Gaza, or (according to some) as Rhinocolura and the Torrens Ægypti.
      Northward the name seems never to have passed beyond Cape Posideium
      (Possidi) at the foot of Mount Casius, the tract between this and the
      range of Taurus being always known as Syria, never as Phoenecia or
      Phoenicé.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entire length of the coast between the limits of Cape Possidi and
      Rhinocolura is, without reckoning the lesser indentations, about 380
      miles, or nearly the same as that of Portugal. The indentations of the
      coast-line are slight. From Rhinocolura to Mount Carmel, a distance of 150
      miles, not a single strong promontory asserts itself, nor is there a
      single bay of sufficient depth to attract the attention of geographers.
      Carmel itself is a notable headland, and shelters a bay of some size; but
      these once passed the old uniformity returns, the line being again almost
      unbroken for a distance of seventy-five miles, from Haifa to Beyrout
      (Berytus). North of Beyrout we find a little more variety. The coast
      projects in a tolerably bold sweep between the thirty-fourth parallel and
      Tripolis (Tarabulus) and recedes almost correspondingly between Tripolis
      and Tortosa (Antaradus), so that a deepish bay is formed between Lat. 34º
      27´ and Lat. 34º 45´, whence the line again runs northward unindented for
      fifty miles, to beyond Gabala (Jebili). After this, between Gabala and
      Cape Posideium there is considerable irregularity, the whole tract being
      mountainous, and spurs from Bargylus and Casius running down into the sea
      and forming a succession of headlands, of which Cape Posideium is the most
      remarkable.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while the name Phoenicia is applied geographically to this long extent&mdash;nearly
      400 miles&mdash;of coast-line, historically and ethnically it has to be
      reduced within considerably narrower limits. A race, quite distinct from
      that of the Phoenicians, was settled from an early date on the southern
      portion of the west Asian coast, where it verges towards Africa. From
      Jabneh (Yebna) southwards was Palestine, the country of the Philistines,
      perhaps even from Joppa (Jaffa), which is made the boundary by Mela.<a
      href="#linknote-13" name="linknoteref-13" id="linknoteref-13">13</a> Thus
      at least eighty miles of coast-line must be deducted from the 380, and the
      length of Phoenicia along the Mediterranean shore must be regarded as not
      exceeding three hundred miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The width varied from eight or ten miles to thirty. We must regard as the
      eastern boundary of Phoenicia the high ridge which forms the watershed
      between the streams that flow eastward toward the Orontes, Litany, and
      Jordan, and those that flow westward into the Mediterranean. It is
      difficult to say what was the <i>average</i> width, but perhaps it may be
      fairly estimated at about fifteen miles. In this case the entire area
      would have been about 4,500 square miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tract was one of a remarkably diversified character. Lofty mountain,
      steep wooded hill, chalky slope, rich alluvial plain, and sandy shore
      succeeded each other, each having its own charm, which was enhanced by
      contrast. The sand is confined to a comparatively narrow strip along the
      seashore,<a href="#linknote-14" name="linknoteref-14" id="linknoteref-14">14</a>
      and to the sites of ancient harbours now filled up. It is exceedingly fine
      and of excellent silicious quality, especially in the vicinity of Sidon
      and at the foot of Mount Carmel. The most remarkable plains are those of
      Sharon, Acre, Tyre, Sidon, Beyrout, and Marathus. Sharon, so dear to the
      Hebrew poets,<a href="#linknote-15" name="linknoteref-15"
       id="linknoteref-15">15</a> is the maritime tract intervening between the
      highland of Samaria and the Mediterranean, extending from Joppa to the
      southern foot of Carmel&mdash;a distance of nearly sixty miles&mdash;and
      watered by the Chorseas, the Kaneh, and other rivers. It is a smooth, very
      slightly undulating tract, about ten miles in width from the sea to the
      foot of the mountains, which rise up abruptly from it without any
      intervening region of hills, and seem to bound it as a wall, above which
      tower the huge rounded masses of Ebal and Gerizim, with the wooded cone,
      on which stood Samaria, nestling at their feet.<a href="#linknote-16"
       name="linknoteref-16" id="linknoteref-16">16</a> The sluggish streams,
      several of them containing water during the whole of the year, make their
      way across it between reedy banks,<a href="#linknote-17"
       name="linknoteref-17" id="linknoteref-17">17</a> and generally spread out
      before reaching the shore into wide marshes, which might be easily
      utilised for purposes of irrigation. The soil is extremely rich, varying
      from bright red to deep black, and producing enormous crops of weeds or
      grain, according as it is cultivated or left in a state of nature. Towards
      the south the view over the region has been thus described: &ldquo;From Ramleh
      there is a wide view on every side, presenting a prospect rarely surpassed
      in richness and beauty. I could liken it to nothing but the great plain of
      the Rhine by Heidelberg or, better still, to the vast plains of Lombardy,
      as seen from the cathedral of Milan and elsewhere. In the east the
      frowning mountains of Judah rose abruptly from the tract at their foot;
      while on the west, in fine contrast, the glittering waves of the
      Mediterranean Sea associated our thoughts with Europe. Towards the north
      and south, as far as the eye could reach, the beautiful plain was spread
      out like a carpet at our feet, variegated with tracts of brown from which
      the crops had just been taken, and with fields still rich with the yellow
      of the ripe corn, or green with the springing millet. Immediately below us
      the eye rested on the immense olive groves of Ramleh and Lydda, and the
      picturesque towers and minarets and domes of these large villages. In the
      plain itself were not many villages, but the tract of hills and the
      mountain-side beyond, especially in the north-east, were perfectly studded
      with them, and as now seen in the reflected beams of the setting sun they
      seemed like white villas and hamlets among the dark hills, presenting an
      appearance of thriftiness and beauty which certainly would not stand a
      closer examination."<a href="#linknote-18" name="linknoteref-18"
       id="linknoteref-18">18</a> Towards its northern end Sharon is narrowed by
      the low hills which gather round the western flanks of Carmel, and
      gradually encroach upon the plain until it terminates against the shoulder
      of the mountain itself, leaving only a narrow beach at the foot of the
      promontory by which it is possible to communicate with the next plain
      towards the north.<a href="#linknote-19" name="linknoteref-19"
       id="linknoteref-19">19</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Compared with Sharon the plain of Acre is unimportant and of small extent.
      It reaches about eight miles along the shore, from the foot of Carmel to
      the headland on which the town of Acre stands, and has a width between the
      shore and the hills of about six miles. Like Sharon it is noted for its
      fertility. Watered by the two permanent streams of the Kishon and the
      Belus, it possesses a rich soil, which is said to be at present &ldquo;perhaps
      the best cultivated and producing the most luxuriant crops, both of corn
      and weeds, of any in Palestine."<a href="#linknote-110"
       name="linknoteref-110" id="linknoteref-110">110</a> The Kishon waters it
      on the south, where it approaches Carmel, and is a broad stream,<a
      href="#linknote-111" name="linknoteref-111" id="linknoteref-111">111</a>
      though easily fordable towards its mouth. The Belus (Namâané) flows
      through it towards the north, washing Acre itself, and is a stream of even
      greater volume than the Kishon, though it has but a short course.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third of the Phoenician plains, as we proceed from south to north, is
      that of Tyre. This is a long but comparatively narrow strip, reaching from
      the Ras-el-Abiad towards the south to Sarepta on the north, a distance of
      about twenty miles, but in no part more than five miles across, and
      generally less than two miles. It is watered about midway by the copious
      stream of the Kasimiyeh or Litany, which, rising east of Lebanon in the
      Buka&rsquo;a or Coelesyrian valley, forces its way through the mountain chain by
      a series of tremendous gorges, and debouches upon the Tyrian lowland about
      three miles to the south-east of the present city, near the modern
      Khan-el-Kasimiyeh, whence it flows peaceably to the sea with many windings
      through a broad low tract of meadow-land. Other rills and rivulets
      descending from the west flank of the great mountain increase the
      productiveness of the plain, while copious fountains of water gush forth
      with surprising force in places, more especially at Ras-el-Ain, three
      miles from Tyre, to the south.<a href="#linknote-112"
       name="linknoteref-112" id="linknoteref-112">112</a> The plain is, even at
      the present day, to a large extent covered with orchards, gardens, and
      cultivated fields, in which are grown rich crops of tobacco, cotton, and
      cereals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plain of Sidon, which follows that of Tyre, and is sometimes regarded
      as a part of it,<a href="#linknote-113" name="linknoteref-113"
       id="linknoteref-113">113</a> extends from a little north of Sarepta to the
      Ras-el-Jajunieh, a distance of about ten miles, and resembles that of Tyre
      in its principal features. It is long and narrow, never more than about
      two miles in width, but well-watered and very fertile. The principal
      streams are the Bostrenus (Nahr-el-Auly) in the north, just inside the
      promontory of Jajunieh, the Nahr-Sanîk, south of Sidon, a torrent dry in
      the summer-time,<a href="#linknote-114" name="linknoteref-114"
       id="linknoteref-114">114</a> and the Nahr-ez-Zaherany, two and a half
      miles north of Sarepta, a river of moderate capacity. Fine fountains also
      burst from the earth in the plain itself, as the Ain-el-Kanterah and the
      Ain-el-Burâk,<a href="#linknote-115" name="linknoteref-115"
       id="linknoteref-115">115</a> between Sarepta and the Zaherany river.
      Irrigation is easy and is largely used, with the result that the fruits
      and vegetables of Saïda and its environs have the name of being among the
      finest of the country.<a href="#linknote-116" name="linknoteref-116"
       id="linknoteref-116">116</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The plain of Berytus (Beyrout) is the most contracted of all the
      Phoenician plains that are at all noticeable. It lies south, south-east,
      and east of the city, intervening between the high dunes or sand-hills
      which form the western portion of the Beyrout peninsula, and the skirts of
      Lebanon, which here approach very near to the sea. The plain begins at
      Wady Shuweifat on the south, about four miles from the town of Beyrout,
      and extends northwards to the sea on the western side of the Nahr Beyrout.
      The northern part of the plain is known as Ard-el-Burâjineh. The plain is
      deficient in water,<a href="#linknote-117" name="linknoteref-117"
       id="linknoteref-117">117</a> yet is cultivated in olives and mulberries,
      and contains the largest olive grove in all Syria. A little beyond its
      western edge is the famous pine forest<a href="#linknote-118"
       name="linknoteref-118" id="linknoteref-118">118</a> from which (according
      to some) Berytus derived its name.<a href="#linknote-119"
       name="linknoteref-119" id="linknoteref-119">119</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The plain of Marathus is, next to Sharon, the most extensive in Phoenicia.
      It stretches from Jebili (Gabala) on the north to Arka towards the south,
      a distance of about sixty miles, and has a width varying from two to ten
      miles. The rock crops out from it in places and it is broken between
      Tortosa and Hammam by a line of low hills running parallel with the shore.<a
      href="#linknote-120" name="linknoteref-120" id="linknoteref-120">120</a>
      The principal streams which water it are the Nahr-el-Melk, or Badas, six
      miles south of Jebili, the Nahr Amrith, a strong running brook which
      empties itself into the sea a few miles south of Tortosa (Antaradus), the
      Nahr Kublé, which joins the Nahr Amrith near its mouth, and the Eleutherus
      or Nahr-el-Kabir, which reaches the sea a little north of Arka. Of these
      the Eleutherus is the most important. &ldquo;It is a considerable stream even in
      summer, and in the rainy season it is a barrier to intercourse, caravans
      sometimes remaining encamped on its banks for several weeks, unable to
      cross."<a href="#linknote-121" name="linknoteref-121" id="linknoteref-121">121</a>
      The soil of the plain is shallow, the rock lying always near the surface;
      the streams are allowed to run to waste and form marshes, which breed
      malaria; a scanty population scarcely attempts more than the rudest and
      most inefficient cultivation; and the consequence is that the tract at
      present is almost a desert. Nature, however, shows its capabilities by
      covering it in the spring-time from end to end with a &ldquo;carpet of flowers."<a
      href="#linknote-122" name="linknoteref-122" id="linknoteref-122">122</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      From the edges of the plains, and sometimes from the very shore of the
      sea, rise up chalky slopes or steep rounded hills, partly left to nature
      and covered with trees and shrubs, partly at the present day cultivated
      and studded with villages. The hilly region forms generally an
      intermediate tract between the high mountains and the plains already
      described; but, not unfrequently, it commences at the water&rsquo;s edge, and
      fills with its undulations the entire space, leaving not even a strip of
      lowland. This is especially the case in the central region between Berytus
      and Arka, opposite the highest portion of the Lebanon; and again in the
      north between Cape Possidi and Jebili, opposite the more northern part of
      Bargylus. The hilly region in these places is a broad tract of alternate
      wooded heights and deep romantic valleys, with streams murmuring amid
      their shades. Sometimes the hills are cultivated in terraces, on which
      grow vines and olives, but more often they remain in their pristine
      condition, clothed with masses of tangled underwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mountain ranges, which belong in some measure to the geography of
      Phoenicia, are four in number&mdash;Carmel, Casius, Bargylus, and Lebanon.
      Carmel is a long hog-backed ridge, running in almost a straight line from
      north-west to south-east, from the promontory which forms the western
      protection of the bay of Acre to El-Ledjun, on the southern verge of the
      great plain of Esdraelon, a distance of about twenty-two miles. It is a
      limestone formation, and rises up abruptly from the side of the bay of
      Acre, with flanks so steep and rugged that the traveller must dismount in
      order to ascend them,<a href="#linknote-123" name="linknoteref-123"
       id="linknoteref-123">123</a> but slopes more gently towards the south,
      where it is comparatively easy of access. The greatest elevation which it
      attains is about Lat. 32º 4´, where it reaches the height of rather more
      than 1,200 feet; from this it falls gradually as it nears the shore, until
      at the convent, with which the western extremity is crowned, the height
      above the sea is no more than 582 feet. In ancient times the whole
      mountain was thickly wooded,<a href="#linknote-124" name="linknoteref-124"
       id="linknoteref-124">124</a> but at present, though it contains &ldquo;rocky
      dells&rdquo; where there are &ldquo;thick jungles of copse,"<a href="#linknote-125"
       name="linknoteref-125" id="linknoteref-125">125</a> and is covered in
      places with olive groves and thickets of dwarf oak, yet its appearance is
      rather that of a park than of a forest, long stretches of grass
      alternating with patches of woodland and &ldquo;shrubberies, thicker than any in
      Central Palestine,&rdquo; while the larger trees grow in clumps or singly, and
      there is nowhere, as in Lebanon, any dense growth, or even any
      considerable grove, of forest trees. But the beauty of the tract is
      conspicuous; and if Carmel means, as some interpret, a &ldquo;garden&rdquo; rather
      than a &ldquo;forest,&rdquo; it may be held to well justify its appellation. &ldquo;The
      whole mountain-side,&rdquo; says one traveller,<a href="#linknote-126"
       name="linknoteref-126" id="linknoteref-126">126</a> &ldquo;was dressed with
      blossoms and flowering shrubs and fragrant herbs.&rdquo; &ldquo;There is not a
      flower,&rdquo; says another,<a href="#linknote-127" name="linknoteref-127"
       id="linknoteref-127">127</a> &ldquo;that I have seen in Galilee, or on the
      plains along the coast, that I do not find on Carmel, still the fragrant,
      lovely mountain that he was of old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The geological structure of Carmel is, in the main, what is called &ldquo;the
      Jura formation,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the upper oolite&rdquo;&mdash;a soft white limestone, with
      nodules and veins of flint. At the western extremity, where it overhangs
      the Mediterranean, are found chalk, and tertiary breccia formed of
      fragments of chalk and flint. On the north-east of the mountain, beyond
      the Nahr-el-Mukattah, plutonic rocks appear, breaking through the deposit
      strata, and forming the beginning of the basalt formation which runs
      through the plain of Esdraelon to Tabor and the Sea of Galilee.<a
      href="#linknote-128" name="linknoteref-128" id="linknoteref-128">128</a>
      Like most limestone formations, Carmel abounds in caves, which are said to
      be more than 2,000 in number,<a href="#linknote-129" name="linknoteref-129"
       id="linknoteref-129">129</a> and are often of great length and extremely
      tortuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmel, the great southern headland of Phoenicia, is balanced in a certain
      sense by the extreme northern headland of Casius. Mount Casius is,
      strictly speaking, the termination of a spur from Bargylus; but it has so
      marked and peculiar a character that it seems entitled to separate
      description. Rising up abruptly from the Mediterranean to the height of
      5,318 feet, it dominates the entire region in its vicinity, and from the
      sea forms a landmark that is extraordinarily conspicuous. Forests of fine
      trees clothe its flanks, but the lofty summit towers high above them, a
      bare mass of rock, known at the present day as Jebel-el-Akra, or &ldquo;the Bald
      Mountain.&rdquo; It is formed mainly of the same cretaceous limestone as the
      other mountains of these parts, and like them has a rounded summit; but
      rocks of igneous origin enter into its geological structure; and in its
      vegetation it more resembles the mountain ranges of Taurus and Amanus than
      those of southern Syria and Palestine. On its north-eastern prolongation,
      which is washed by the Orontes, lay the enchanting pleasure-ground of
      Daphné, bubbling with fountains, and bright with flowering shrubs, where
      from a remote antiquity the Syrians held frequent festival to their
      favourite deity&mdash;the &ldquo;Dea Syra&rdquo;&mdash;the great nature goddess.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elevated tract known to the ancients as Bargylus, and to modern
      geographers as the Ansayrieh or Nasariyeh mountain-region, runs at right
      angles to the spur terminating in the Mount Casius, and extends from the
      Orontes near Antioch to the valley of the Eleutherus. This is a distance
      of not less than a hundred miles. The range forms the western boundary of
      the lower Coelesyrian valley, which abuts upon it towards the east, while
      westward it looks down upon the region, partly hill, partly lowland, which
      may be regarded as constituting &ldquo;Northern Phoenicia.&rdquo; The axis of the
      range is almost due north and south, but with a slight deflection towards
      the south-east. Bargylus is not a chain comparable to Lebanon, but still
      it is a romantic and picturesque region. The lower spurs towards the west
      are clothed with olive grounds and vineyards, or covered with myrtles and
      rhododendrons; between them are broad open valleys, productive of tobacco
      and corn. Higher up &ldquo;the scenery becomes wild and bold; hill rises to
      mountain; soft springing green corn gives place to sterner crag, smooth
      plain to precipitous heights;"<a href="#linknote-130"
       name="linknoteref-130" id="linknoteref-130">130</a> and if in the more
      elevated region the majesty of the cedar is wanting, yet forests of fir
      and pine abound, and creep up the mountain-side, in places almost to the
      summit, while here and there bare masses of rock protrude themselves, and
      crag and cliff rise into the clouds that hang about the highest summits.
      Water abounds throughout the region, which is the parent of numerous
      streams, as the northern Nahr-el-Kebir, which flows into the sea by
      Latakia, the Nahr-el-Melk, the Nahr Amrith, the Nahr Kublé, the
      Nahr-el-Abrath, and many others. From the conformation of the land they
      have of necessity short courses; but each and all of them spread along
      their banks a rich verdure and an uncommon fertility.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the <i>great</i> range of Phoenicia, its glory and its boast is
      Lebanon. Lebanon, the &ldquo;White Mountain"<a href="#linknote-131"
       name="linknoteref-131" id="linknoteref-131">131</a>&mdash;&ldquo;the Mont Blanc
      of Palestine"<a href="#linknote-132" name="linknoteref-132"
       id="linknoteref-132">132</a>&mdash;now known as &ldquo;the Old White-headed Man&rdquo;
       (Jebel-esh-Sheikh), or &ldquo;the Mountain of Ice&rdquo; (Jebel-el-Tilj), was to
      Phoenicia at once its protection, the source of its greatness, and its
      crowning beauty. Extended in a continuous line for a distance of above a
      hundred miles, with an average elevation of from 6,000 to 8,000 feet, and
      steepest on its eastern side, it formed a wall against which the waves of
      eastern invasion naturally broke&mdash;a bulwark which seemed to say to
      them, &ldquo;Thus far shall ye go, and no further.&rdquo; The flood of conquest swept
      along its eastern flank, down the broad vale of the Buka&rsquo;a, and then over
      the hills of Galilee; but its frowning precipices and its lofty crest
      deterred or baffled the invader, and the smiling region between its summit
      and the Mediterranean was, in the early times at any rate, but rarely
      traversed by a hostile army. This western region it was which held those
      inexhaustible stores of forest trees that supplied Phoenicia with her war
      ships and her immense commercial navy; here were the most productive
      valleys, the vineyards, and the olive grounds, and here too were the
      streams and rills, the dashing cascades, the lovely dells, and the deep
      gorges which gave her the palm over all the surrounding countries for
      variety of picturesque scenery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The geology of the Lebanon is exceedingly complicated. &ldquo;While the bulk of
      the mountain, and all the higher ranges, are without exception limestone
      of the early cretaceous period, the valleys and gorges are filled with
      formations of every possible variety, sedimentary, metamorphic, and
      igneous. Down many of them run long streams of trap or basalt;
      occasionally there are dykes of porphyry and greenstone, and then patches
      of sandstone, before the limestone and flint recur."<a href="#linknote-133"
       name="linknoteref-133" id="linknoteref-133">133</a> Some slopes are
      composed entirely of soft sandstone; many patches are of a hard
      metallic-sounding trap or porphyry; but the predominant formation is a
      greasy or powdery limestone, bare often, but sometimes clothed with a soft
      herbage, or with a thick tangle of shrubs, or with lofty forest trees. The
      ridge of the mountain is everywhere naked limestone rock, except in the
      comparatively few places which attain the highest elevation, where it is
      coated or streaked with snow. Two summits are especially remarkable, that
      of Jebel Sunnin towards the south, which is a conspicuous object from
      Beyrout,<a href="#linknote-134" name="linknoteref-134" id="linknoteref-134">134</a>
      and is estimated to exceed the height of 9,000 feet,<a href="#linknote-135"
       name="linknoteref-135" id="linknoteref-135">135</a> and that of Jebel
      Mukhmel towards the north, which has been carefully measured and found to
      fall a very little short of 10,200 feet.<a href="#linknote-136"
       name="linknoteref-136" id="linknoteref-136">136</a> The latter, which
      forms a sort of amphitheatre, circles round and impends over a deep hollow
      or basin, opening out towards the west, in which rise the chief sources
      that go to form the romantic stream of the Kadisha. The sides of the basin
      are bare and rocky, fringed here and there with the rough knolls which
      mark the deposits of ancient glaciers, the &ldquo;moraines&rdquo; of the Lebanon. In
      this basin stand &ldquo;the Cedars.&rdquo; It is not indeed true, as was for a long
      time supposed, that the cedar grove of Jebel Mukhmel is the sole remnant
      of that primeval cedar-forest which was anciently the glory of the
      mountain. Cedars exist on Lebanon in six other places at least, if not in
      more. Near Tannurin, on one of the feeders of the Duweir, a wild gorge is
      clothed from top to bottom with a forest of trees, untouched by the axe,
      the haunt of the panther and the bear, which on examination have been
      found to be all cedars, some of a large size, from fifteen to eighteen
      feet in girth. They grow in clusters, or scattered singly, in every
      variety of situation, some clinging to the steep slopes, or gnarled and
      twisted on the bare hilltops, others sheltered in the recesses of the
      dell. There are also cedar-groves at B&rsquo;sherrah; at El Hadith; near Dûma,
      five hours south-west of El Hadith; in one of the glens north of
      Deir-el-Kamar, at Etnub, and probably in other places.<a
      href="#linknote-137" name="linknoteref-137" id="linknoteref-137">137</a>
      But still &ldquo;the Cedars&rdquo; of Jebel Mukhmel are entitled to pre-eminence over
      all the rest, both as out-numbering any other cluster, and still more as
      exceeding all the rest in size and apparent antiquity. Some of the
      patriarchs are of enormous girth; even the younger ones have a
      circumference of eighteen feet; and the height is such that the birds
      which dwell among the upper branches are beyond the range of an ordinary
      fowling-piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is through the contrasts which it presents that Lebanon has its
      extraordinary power of attracting and delighting the traveller. Below the
      upper line of bare and worn rock, streaked in places with snow, and seamed
      with torrent courses, a region is entered upon where the freshest and
      softest mountain herbage, the greenest foliage, and the most brilliant
      flowers alternate with deep dells, tremendous gorges, rocky ravines, and
      precipices a thousand feet high. Scarcely has the voyager descended from
      the upper region of naked and rounded rock, when he comes upon &ldquo;a
      tremendous chasm&mdash;the bare amphitheatre of the upper basin contracts
      into a valley of about 2,000 feet deep, rent at its bottom into a cleft a
      thousand feet deeper still, down which dashes a river, buried between
      these stupendous walls of rock. All above the chasm is terraced as far as
      the eye can reach with indefatigable industry. Tiny streamlets bound and
      leap from terrace to terrace, fertilising them as they rush to join the
      torrent in the abyss. Some of the waterfalls are of great height and of
      considerable volume. From one spot may be counted no less than seven of
      these cascades, now dashing in white spray over a cliff, now lost under
      the shade of trees, soon to reappear over the next shelving rock."<a
      href="#linknote-138" name="linknoteref-138" id="linknoteref-138">138</a>
      Or, to quote from another writer,<a href="#linknote-139"
       name="linknoteref-139" id="linknoteref-139">139</a>&mdash;&ldquo;The descent
      from the summit is gradual, but is everywhere broken by precipices and
      towering rocks, which time and the elements have chiselled into strange
      fantastic shapes. Ravines of singular wildness and grandeur furrow the
      whole mountain-side, looking in many places like huge rents. Here and
      there, too, bold promontories shoot out, and dip perpendicularly into the
      bosom of the Mediterranean. The ragged limestone banks are scantily
      clothed with the evergreen oak, and the sandstone with pines; while every
      available spot is carefully cultivated. The cultivation is wonderful, and
      shows what all Syria might be of under a good government. Miniature fields
      of grain are often seen where one would suppose that the eagles alone,
      which hover round them, could have planted the seed. Fig-trees cling to
      the naked rock; vines are trained along narrow ledges; long ranges of
      mulberries on terraces like steps of stairs cover the more gentle
      declivities; and dense groves of olives fill up the bottoms of the glens.
      Hundreds of villages are seen, here built amid labyrinths of rock, there
      clinging like swallows&rsquo; nests to the sides of cliffs, while convents, no
      less numerous, are perched on the top of every peak. When viewed from the
      sea on a morning in early spring, Lebanon presents a picture which once
      seen is never forgotten; but deeper still is the impression left on the
      mind, when one looks down over its terraced slopes clothed in their
      gorgeous foliage, and through the vistas of its magnificent glens, on the
      broad and bright Mediterranean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eastern flank of the mountain falls very far short of the western both
      in area and in beauty. It is a comparatively narrow region, and presents
      none of the striking features of gorge, ravine, deep dell, and dashing
      stream which diversify the side that looks westward. The steep slopes are
      generally bare, the lower portion only being scantily clothed with
      deciduous oak, for the most part stunted, and with low scrub of juniper
      and barberry.<a href="#linknote-140" name="linknoteref-140"
       id="linknoteref-140">140</a> Towards the north there is an outer barrier,
      parallel with the main chain, on which follows a tolerably flat and rather
      bare plain, well watered, and with soft turf in many parts, which gently
      slopes to the foot of the main ascent, a wall of rock generally half
      covered with snow, up which winds the rough track whereby travellers reach
      the summit. Rills of water are not wanting; flowers bloom to the very edge
      of the snow, and the walnut-tree flourishes in sheltered places to within
      two or three thousand feet of the summit; but the general character of the
      tract is bare and bleak; the villages are few; and the terraced
      cultivation, which adds so much to the beauty of the western side, is
      wanting. In the southern half of the range the descent is abrupt from the
      crest of the mountain into the Buka&rsquo;a, or valley of the Litany, and the
      aspect of the mountain-side is one of &ldquo;unrelieved bareness."<a
      href="#linknote-141" name="linknoteref-141" id="linknoteref-141">141</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      There is, however, one beauty at one point on this side of the Lebanon
      range which is absent from the more favoured western region. On the ascent
      from Baalbek to the Cedars the traveller comes upon Lake Lemone, a
      beautiful mountain tarn, without any apparent exit, the only sheet of
      water in the Lebanon. Lake Lemone is of a long oval shape, about two miles
      from one end to the other, and is fed by a stream entering at either
      extremity, that from the north, which comes down from the village of
      Ainât, being the more important. As the water which comes into the lake
      cannot be discharged by evaporation, we must suppose some underground
      outlet,<a href="#linknote-142" name="linknoteref-142" id="linknoteref-142">142</a>
      by which it is conveyed, through the limestone, into the Litany.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eastern side of Lebanon drains entirely into this river, which is the
      only stream whereto it gives birth. The Litany is the principal of all the
      Phoenician rivers, for the Orontes must be counted not to Phoenicia but to
      Syria. It rises from a small pool or lake near Tel Hushben,<a
      href="#linknote-143" name="linknoteref-143" id="linknoteref-143">143</a>
      about six miles to the south-west of the Baalbek ruins. Springing from
      this source, which belongs to Antilibanus rather than to Lebanon, the
      Litany shortly receives a large accession to its waters from the opposite
      side of the valley, and thus augmented flows along the lower Buka&rsquo;a in a
      direction which is generally a little west of south, receiving on either
      side a number of streams and rills from both mountains, and giving out in
      its turn numerous canals for irrigation. As the river descends with
      numerous windings, but still with the same general course, the valley of
      the Buka&rsquo;a contracts more and more, till finally it terminates in a gorge
      of a most extraordinary character. Nothing in the conformation of the
      strata, or in the lie of ground, indicates the coming marvel<a
      href="#linknote-144" name="linknoteref-144" id="linknoteref-144">144</a>&mdash;the
      roots of Lebanon and Hermon appear to intermix&mdash;and the further
      progress of the river seems to be barred by a rocky ridge stretching
      across the valley from east to west, when lo! suddenly, the ridge is cut,
      as if by a knife, and a deep and narrow chasm opens in it, down which the
      stream plunges in a cleft 200 feet deep, and so narrow that in one place
      it is actually bridged over by masses of rock which have fallen from the
      cliffs above.<a href="#linknote-145" name="linknoteref-145"
       id="linknoteref-145">145</a> In the gully below fig-trees and planes,
      besides many shrubs, find a footing, and the moist walls of rock on either
      side are hung with ferns of various kinds, among which is conspicuous the
      delicate and graceful maidenhair. Further down the chasm deepens, first to
      1,000 and then to 1,500 feet, &ldquo;the torrent roars in the gorge, milk-white
      and swollen often with the melting snow, overhung with semi-tropical
      oleanders, fig-trees, and oriental planes, while the upper cliffs are clad
      with northern vegetation, two zones of climate thus being visible at
      once."<a href="#linknote-146" name="linknoteref-146" id="linknoteref-146">146</a>
      Where the gorge is the deepest, opposite the Castle of Belfort (the modern
      Kulat-esh-Shukif), the river suddenly makes a turn at right angles,
      altering its course from nearly due south to nearly due west, and cuts
      through the remaining roots of Lebanon, still at the bottom of a
      tremendous fissure, and still raging and chafing for a distance of fifteen
      miles, until at length it debouches on the coast plain, and meanders
      slowly through meadows to the sea,<a href="#linknote-147"
       name="linknoteref-147" id="linknoteref-147">147</a> which it enters about
      five miles to the north of Tyre. The course of the Litany may be roughly
      estimated at from seventy to seventy-five miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other streams to which Lebanon gives birth flow either from its
      northern or its western flank. From the northern flank flows one stream
      only, the Nahr-el-Kebir or Eleutherus. The course of this stream is short,
      not much exceeding thirty miles. It rises from several sources at the edge
      of the Coelesyrian valley, and, receiving affluents from either side,
      flows westward between Bargylus and Lebanon to the Mediterranean, which it
      enters between Orthosia (Artousi) and Marathus (Amrith) with a stream, the
      volume of which is even in the summer-time considerable. In the rainy
      season it constitutes an important impediment to intercourse, since it
      frequently sweeps away any bridge which may be thrown across it, and is
      itself unfordable. Caravans sometimes remain encamped upon its banks for
      weeks, waiting until the swell has subsided and crossing is no longer
      dangerous.<a href="#linknote-148" name="linknoteref-148"
       id="linknoteref-148">148</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      From the western flank of Lebanon flow above a hundred streams of various
      dimensions, whereof the most important are the Nahr-el-Berid or river of
      Orthosia, the Kadisha or river of Tripolis, the Ibrahim or Adonis, the
      Nahr-el-Kelb or Lycus, the Damour or Tamyras, the Auly (Aouleh) or
      Bostrenus, and the Zaherany, of which the ancient name is unknown to us.
      The Nahr-el-Berid drains the north-western angle of the mountain chain,
      and is formed of two main branches, one coming down from the higher
      portion of the range, about Lat. 34º 20´, and flowing to the north-west,
      while the other descends from a region of much less elevation, about Lat.
      34º 30´, and runs a little south of west to the point of junction. The
      united stream then forces its way down a gorge in a north-west direction,
      and enters the sea at Artousi, probably the ancient Orthosia.<a
      href="#linknote-149" name="linknoteref-149" id="linknoteref-149">149</a>
      The length of the river from its remotest fountain to its mouth is about
      twenty miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Kadisha or &ldquo;Holy River&rdquo; has its source in the deep basin already
      described, round which rise in a semicircle the loftiest peaks of the
      range, and on the edge of which stand &ldquo;the Cedars.&rdquo; Fed by the perpetual
      snows, it shortly becomes a considerable stream, and flows nearly due west
      down a beautiful valley, where the terraced slopes are covered with
      vineyards and mulberry groves, and every little dell, every nook and
      corner among the jagged rocks, every ledge and cranny on precipice-side,
      which the foot of man can reach, or on which a basket of earth can be
      deposited, is occupied with patch of corn or fruit-tree.<a
      href="#linknote-150" name="linknoteref-150" id="linknoteref-150">150</a>
      Lower down near Canobin the valley contracts into a sublime chasm, its
      rocky walls rising perpendicularly a thousand feet on either side, and in
      places not leaving room for even a footpath beside the stream that flows
      along the bottom.<a href="#linknote-151" name="linknoteref-151"
       id="linknoteref-151">151</a> The water of the Kadisha is &ldquo;pure, fresh,
      cool, and limpid,"<a href="#linknote-152" name="linknoteref-152"
       id="linknoteref-152">152</a> and makes a paradise along its entire course.
      Below Canobin the stream sweeps round in a semicircle towards the north,
      and still running in a picturesque glen, draws near to Tripolis, where it
      bends towards the north-west, and enters the sea after passing through the
      town. Its course, including main windings, measures about twenty-five
      miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ibrahim, or Adonis, has its source near Afka (Apheca) in Lat. 34º 4´
      nearly. It bursts from a cave at the foot of a tremendous cliff, and its
      foaming waters rush down into a wild chasm.<a href="#linknote-153"
       name="linknoteref-153" id="linknoteref-153">153</a> Its flow is at first
      towards the north-west, but after receiving a small tributary from the
      north-east, it shapes its course nearly westward, and pursues this
      direction, with only slight bends to the north and south, for the distance
      of about fifteen miles to the sea. After heavy rain in Lebanon, its
      waters, which are generally clear and limpid, become tinged with the earth
      which the swollen torrent detaches from the mountain-side,<a
      href="#linknote-154" name="linknoteref-154" id="linknoteref-154">154</a>
      and Adonis thus &ldquo;runs purple to the sea&rdquo;&mdash;not however once a year
      only, but many times. It enters the Mediterranean about four miles south
      of Byblus (Jebeil) and six north of Djouni.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lycus or Nahr-el-Kelb (&ldquo;Dog River&rdquo;) flows from the northern and
      western flanks of Jebel Sunnin. It is formed by the confluence of three
      main streams. One of these rises near Afka, and runs to the south of west,
      past the castle and temples of Fakra, to its junction with the second
      stream, which is formed of several rivulets flowing from the northern
      flank of Sunnin. Near Bufkeiya the river constituted by the union of these
      two branches is joined by a third stream flowing from the western flank of
      Sunnin with a westerly course, and from this point the Lycus pursues its
      way in the same general direction down a magnificent gorge to the
      Mediterranean. Both banks are lofty, but especially that to the south,
      where one of Lebanon&rsquo;s great roots strikes out far, and dips, a rocky
      precipice, into the bosom of the deep.<a href="#linknote-155"
       name="linknoteref-155" id="linknoteref-155">155</a> Low in the depths of
      the gorge the mad torrent dashes over its rocky bed in sheets of foam, its
      banks fringed with oleander, which it bathes with its spray. Above rise
      jagged precipices of white limestone, crowned far overhead by many a
      convent and village.<a href="#linknote-156" name="linknoteref-156"
       id="linknoteref-156">156</a> The course of the Nahr-el-Kelbis about equal
      to that of the Adonis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Damour or Tamyras drains the western flank of Lebanon to the south of
      Jebel Sunnin (about Lat. 33º 45´), the districts known as Menassif and
      Jourd Arkoub, about Barouk and Deir-el-Kamar. It collects the waters from
      an area of about 110 square miles, and carries them to the sea in a course
      which is a little north of west, reaching it half-way between Khan Khulda
      (Heldua) and Nebbi Younas. The scenery along its banks is tame compared
      with that of the more northern rivers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Nahr-el-Auly or Bostrenus rises from a source to the north-east of
      Barouk, and flows in a nearly straight course to the south-west for a
      distance of nearly thirty-five miles, when it is joined by a stream from
      Jezzin, which flows into it from the south-east. On receiving this stream,
      the Auly turns almost at a right angle, and flows to the west down the
      fine alluvial track called Merj Bisry, passing from this point through
      comparatively low ground, and between swelling hills, until it reaches the
      sea two miles to the north of Sidon. Its entire course is not less than
      sixty miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Zaherany repeats on a smaller scale the course of the Bostrenus. It
      rises near Jerjû&rsquo;a from the western flank of Jebel Rihan, the southern
      extremity of the Lebanon range, and flows at first to the south-west. The
      source is &ldquo;a fine large fountain bursting forth with violence, and with
      water enough for a mill race."<a href="#linknote-157"
       name="linknoteref-157" id="linknoteref-157">157</a> From this the river
      flows in a deep valley, brawling and foaming along its course, through
      tracts of green grass shaded by black walnut-trees for a distance of about
      five miles, after which, just opposite Jerjû&rsquo;a, it breaks through one of
      the spurs from Rihan by a magnificent chasm. The gorge is one &ldquo;than which
      there are few deeper or more savage in Lebanon. The mountains on each side
      rise up almost precipitously to the height of two or three thousand feet
      above the stream, that on the northern bank being considerably the higher.
      The steep sides of the southern mountain are dotted with shrub, oak, and
      other dwarf trees."<a href="#linknote-158" name="linknoteref-158"
       id="linknoteref-158">158</a> The river descends in its chasm still in a
      south-west direction until, just opposite Arab Salim, it &ldquo;turns round the
      precipitous corner or bastion of the southern Rihan into a straight
      valley,&rdquo; and proceeds to run due south for a short distance. Meeting,
      however, a slight swell of ground, which blocks what would seem to have
      been its natural course, the river &ldquo;suddenly turns west,&rdquo; and breaking
      through a low ridge by a narrow ravine, pursues its way by a course a
      little north of west to the Mediterranean, which it enters about midway
      between Sidon and Sarepta.<a href="#linknote-159" name="linknoteref-159"
       id="linknoteref-159">159</a> The length of the stream, including main
      windings, is probably not more than thirty-five miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have spoken of the numerous promontories, terminations of spurs from
      the mountains, which break the low coast-line into fragments, and go down
      precipitously into the sea. Of these there are two between Tyre and Acre,
      one known as the Ras-el-Abiad or &ldquo;White Headland,&rdquo; and the other as the
      Ras-en-Nakura. The former is a cliff of snow-white chalk interspersed with
      black flints, and rises perpendicularly from the sea to the height of
      three hundred feet.<a href="#linknote-160" name="linknoteref-160"
       id="linknoteref-160">160</a> The road, which in some places impends over
      the water, has been cut with great labour through the rock, and is said by
      tradition to have been the work of Alexander the Great. Previously, both
      here and at the Ras-en-Nakura, the ascent was by steps, and the passes
      were known as the Climaces Tyriorum, or &ldquo;Staircases of the Tyrians.&rdquo;
       Another similar precipice guards the mouth of the Lycus on its south side
      and has been engineered with considerable skill, first by the Egyptians
      and then by the Romans.<a href="#linknote-161" name="linknoteref-161"
       id="linknoteref-161">161</a> North of this, at Djouni, the coast road
      &ldquo;traverses another pass, where the mountain, descending to the water, has
      been cut to admit it."<a href="#linknote-162" name="linknoteref-162"
       id="linknoteref-162">162</a> Still further north, between Byblus and
      Tripolis, the bold promontory known to the ancients as Theu-prosopon, and
      now called the Ras-esh-Shakkah, is still unconquered, and the road has to
      quit the shore and make its way over the spur by a &ldquo;wearisome ascent"<a
      href="#linknote-163" name="linknoteref-163" id="linknoteref-163">163</a>
      at some distance inland. Again, &ldquo;beyond the Tamyras the hills press
      closely on the sea,"<a href="#linknote-164" name="linknoteref-164"
       id="linknoteref-164">164</a> and there is &ldquo;a rocky and difficult pass,
      along which the path is cut for some distance in the rock."<a
      href="#linknote-165" name="linknoteref-165" id="linknoteref-165">165</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of this conformation of the country was, in early times, to
      render Phoenicia untraversable by a hostile army, and at the same time to
      interpose enormous difficulties in the way of land communication among the
      natives themselves, who must have soon turned their thoughts to the
      possibility of communicating by sea. The various &ldquo;staircases&rdquo; were painful
      and difficult to climb, they gave no passage to animals, and only light
      forms of merchandise could be conveyed by them. As soon as the first rude
      canoe put forth upon the placid waters of the Mediterranean, it must have
      become evident that the saving in time and labour would be great if the
      sea were made to supersede the land as the ordinary line of communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main characteristics of the country were, besides its inaccessibility,
      its picturesqueness and its productiveness. The former of these two
      qualities seems to have possessed but little attraction for man in his
      primitive condition. Beauties of nature are rarely sung of by early poets;
      and it appears to require an educated eye to appreciate them. But
      productiveness is a quality the advantages of which can be perceived by
      all. The eyes which first looked down from the ridge of Bargylus or
      Lebanon upon the well-watered, well-wooded, and evidently fertile tract
      between the mountain summits and the sea, if they took no note of its
      marvellous and almost unequalled beauty, must at any rate have seen that
      here was one of earth&rsquo;s most productive gardens&mdash;emphatically a &ldquo;good
      land,&rdquo; that might well content whosoever should be so fortunate as to
      possess it. There is nothing equal to it in Western Asia. The Damascene
      oasis, the lower valley of the Orontes, the Ghor or Jordan plain, the
      woods of Bashan, and the downs of Moab are fertile and attractive regions;
      but they are comparatively narrow tracts and present little variety; each
      is fitted mainly for one kind of growth, one class of products. Phoenicia,
      in its long extent from Mount Casius to Joppa, and in its combination of
      low alluvial plain, rich valley, sunny slopes and hills, virgin forests,
      and high mountain pasturage, has soils and situations suited for
      productions of all manner of kinds, and for every growth, from that of the
      lowliest herb to that of the most gigantic tree. In the next section an
      account of its probable products in ancient times will be given; for the
      present it is enough to note that Western Asia contained no region more
      favoured or more fitted by its general position, its formation, and the
      character of its soil, to become the home of an important nation.

      The long extent of the Phoenician coast, and the great difference in the
      elevation of its various parts, give it a great diversity of climate.
      Northern Phoenicia is many degrees colder than southern; and the
      difference is still more considerable between the coast tracts and the
      more elevated portions of the mountain regions. The greatest heat is
      experienced in the plain of Sharon,<a href="#linknote-21"
       name="linknoteref-21" id="linknoteref-21">21</a> which is at once the most
      southern portion of the country, and the part most remote from any hills
      of sufficient elevation to exert an important influence on the
      temperature. Neither Carmel on the north, nor the hills of Samaria on the
      east, produce any sensible effect on the climate of the Sharon lowland.
      The heat in summer is intense, and except along the river courses the
      tract is burnt up, and becomes little more than an expanse of sand. As a
      compensation, the cold in winter is very moderate. Snow scarcely ever
      falls, and if there is frost it is short-lived, and does not penetrate
      into the ground.<a href="#linknote-22" name="linknoteref-22"
       id="linknoteref-22">22</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Above Carmel the coast tract is decidedly less hot than the region south
      of it, and becomes cooler and cooler as we proceed northwards. Northern
      Phoenicia enjoys a climate that is delightful, and in which it would be
      difficult to suggest much improvement. The summer heat is scarcely ever
      too great, the thermometer rarely exceeding 90º of Fahrenheit,<a
      href="#linknote-23" name="linknoteref-23" id="linknoteref-23">23</a> and
      often sinking below 70º. Refreshing showers of rain frequently fall, and
      the breezes from the north, the east, and the south-east, coming from high
      mountain tracts which are in part snow-clad, temper the heat of the sun&rsquo;s
      rays and prevent it from being oppressive. The winter temperature seldom
      descends much below 50º; and thus the orange, the lemon and the date-palm
      flourish in the open air, and the gardens are bright with flowers even in
      December and January. Snow falls occasionally, but it rarely lies on the
      ground for more than a few days, and is scarcely ever so much as a foot
      deep. On the other hand, rain is expected during the winter-time, and the
      entire line of coast is visited for some months with severe storms and
      gales, accompanied often by thunder and violent rain,<a href="#linknote-24"
       name="linknoteref-24" id="linknoteref-24">24</a> which strew the shore
      with wrecks and turn even insignificant mountain streams into raging
      torrents. The storms come chiefly from the west and north-west, quarters
      to which the harbours on the coast are unfortunately open.<a
      href="#linknote-25" name="linknoteref-25" id="linknoteref-25">25</a>
      Navigation consequently suffers interruption; but when once the winter is
      past, a season of tranquillity sets in, and for many months of the year&mdash;at
      any rate from May to October<a href="#linknote-26" name="linknoteref-26"
       id="linknoteref-26">26</a>&mdash;the barometer scarcely varies, the sky is
      unclouded, and rain all but unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the traveller mounts from the coast tract into the more elevated
      regions, the climate sensibly changes. An hour&rsquo;s ride from the plains,
      when they are most sultry, will bring him into a comparatively cool
      region, where the dashing spray of the glacier streams is borne on the
      air, and from time to time a breeze that is actually cold comes down from
      the mountain-tops.<a href="#linknote-27" name="linknoteref-27"
       id="linknoteref-27">27</a> Shade is abundant, for the rocks are often
      perpendicular, and overhand the road in places, while the dense foliage of
      cedars, or pines, or walnut-trees, forms an equally effectual screen
      against the sun&rsquo;s noonday rays. In winter the uplands are, of course,
      cold. Severe weather prevails in them from November to March;<a
      href="#linknote-28" name="linknoteref-28" id="linknoteref-28">28</a> snow
      falls on all the high ground, while it rains on the coast and in the
      lowlands; the passes are blocked; and Lebanon and Bargylus replenish the
      icy stories which the summer&rsquo;s heat has diminished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vegetable productions of Phoenicia may be best considered under the
      several heads of trees, shrubs, herbs, flowers, fruit-trees, and garden
      vegetables. The chief trees were the palm-tree, the sycamore, the maritime
      pine, and the plane in the lowlands; in the highlands the cedar, Aleppo
      pine, oak, walnut, poplar, acacia, shumac, and carob. We have spoken of
      the former abundance of the palm. At present it is found in comparatively
      few places, and seldom in any considerable numbers. It grows singly, or in
      groups of two or three, at various points of the coast from Tripolis to
      Acre, but is only abundant in a few spots more towards the south, as at
      Haifa, under Carmel, where &ldquo;fine date-palms&rdquo; are numerous in the gardens,<a
      href="#linknote-29" name="linknoteref-29" id="linknoteref-29">29</a> and
      at Jaffa, where travellers remark &ldquo;a broad belt of two or three miles of
      date-palms and orange-groves laden with fruit."<a href="#linknote-210"
       name="linknoteref-210" id="linknoteref-210">210</a> The wood was probably
      not much used as timber except in the earliest times, since Lebanon
      afforded so many kinds of trees much superior for building purposes. The
      date-palm was also valued for its fruit, though the produce of the
      Phoenician groves can never have been of a high quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sycamore, or sycamine-fig, is a dark-foliaged tree, with a gnarled
      stem when it is old;<a href="#linknote-211" name="linknoteref-211"
       id="linknoteref-211">211</a> it grows either singly or in clumps, and much
      more resembles in appearance the English oak than the terebinth does,
      which has been so often compared to it. The stem is short, and sends forth
      wide lateral branches forking out in all directions, which renders the
      tree very easy to climb. It bears a small fig in great abundance, and
      probably at all seasons, which, however, is &ldquo;tasteless and woody,"<a
      href="#linknote-212" name="linknoteref-212" id="linknoteref-212">212</a>
      though eaten by the inhabitants. The sycamore is common along the
      Phoenician lowland, but is a very tender tree and will not grow in the
      mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plane-tree, common in Asia Minor, is not very frequent either in
      Phoenicia or Palestine. It occurs, however, on the middle course of the
      Litany, where it breaks through the roots of Lebanon,<a
      href="#linknote-213" name="linknoteref-213" id="linknoteref-213">213</a>
      and also in many of the valleys<a href="#linknote-214"
       name="linknoteref-214" id="linknoteref-214">214</a> on the western flank
      of the mountain. The maritime pine (<i>Pinus maritama</i>) extends in
      forests here and there along the shore,<a href="#linknote-215"
       name="linknoteref-215" id="linknoteref-215">215</a> and is found of
      service in checking the advance of the sand dunes, which have a tendency
      to encroach seriously on the cultivable soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the upland trees the most common is the oak. There are three species of
      oak in the country. The most prevalent is an evergreen oak (<i>Quercus
      pseudococcifera</i>), sometimes mistaken by travellers for a holly,
      sometimes for an ibex, which covers in a low dense bush many miles of the
      hilly country everywhere, and occasionally becomes a large tree in the
      Lebanon valleys,<a href="#linknote-216" name="linknoteref-216"
       id="linknoteref-216">216</a> and on the flanks of Casius and Bargylus.
      Another common oak is <i>Quercus Ægilops</i>, a much smaller and deciduous
      tree, very stout-trunked, which grows in scattered groups on Carmel and
      elsewhere, &ldquo;giving a park-like appearance to the landscape."<a
      href="#linknote-217" name="linknoteref-217" id="linknoteref-217">217</a>
      The third kind is <i>Quercus infectoria</i>, a gall-oak, also deciduous,
      and very conspicuous from the large number of bright, chestnut-coloured,
      viscid galls which it bears, and which are now sometimes gathered for
      exportation.<a href="#linknote-218" name="linknoteref-218"
       id="linknoteref-218">218</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Next to the oak may be mentioned the walnut, which grows to a great size
      in sheltered positions in the Lebanon range, both upon the eastern and
      upon the western flank;<a href="#linknote-219" name="linknoteref-219"
       id="linknoteref-219">219</a> the poplar, which is found both in the
      mountains<a href="#linknote-220" name="linknoteref-220"
       id="linknoteref-220">220</a> and in the low country, as especially about
      Beyrout;<a href="#linknote-221" name="linknoteref-221" id="linknoteref-221">221</a>
      the Aleppo pine (<i>Pinus halepensis</i>), of which there are large woods
      in Carmel, Lebanon, and Bargylus,<a href="#linknote-222"
       name="linknoteref-222" id="linknoteref-222">222</a> while in Casius there
      is an enormous forest of them;<a href="#linknote-223"
       name="linknoteref-223" id="linknoteref-223">223</a> and the carob (<i>Ceratonia
      siliqua</i>), or locust-tree, a dense-foliaged tree of a bright lucid
      green hue, which never grows in clumps or forms woods, but appears as an
      isolated tree, rounded or oblong, and affords the best possible shade.<a
      href="#linknote-224" name="linknoteref-224" id="linknoteref-224">224</a>
      In the vicinity of Tyre are found also large tamarisks, maples, sumachs,
      and acacias.<a href="#linknote-225" name="linknoteref-225"
       id="linknoteref-225">225</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      But the tree which is the glory of Phoenicia, and which was by far the
      most valuable of all its vegetable productions, is, of course, the cedar.
      Growing to an immense height, and attaining an enormous girth, it spreads
      abroad its huge flat branches hither and thither, covering a vast space of
      ground with its &ldquo;shadowing shroud,"<a href="#linknote-226"
       name="linknoteref-226" id="linknoteref-226">226</a> and presenting a most
      majestic and magnificent appearance. Its timber may not be of first-rate
      quality, and there is some question whether it was really used for the
      masts of their ships by the Phoenicians,<a href="#linknote-227"
       name="linknoteref-227" id="linknoteref-227">227</a> but as building
      material it was beyond a doubt most highly prized, answering sufficiently
      for all the purposes required by architectural art, and at the same time
      delighting the sense of smell by its aromatic odour. Solomon employed it
      both for the Temple and for his own house;<a href="#linknote-228"
       name="linknoteref-228" id="linknoteref-228">228</a> the Assyrian kings cut
      it and carried it to Nineveh;<a href="#linknote-229" name="linknoteref-229"
       id="linknoteref-229">229</a> Herod the Great used it for the vast
      additions that he made to Zerubbabel&rsquo;s temple;<a href="#linknote-230"
       name="linknoteref-230" id="linknoteref-230">230</a> it was exported to
      Egypt and Asia Minor; the Ephesian Greeks constructed of cedar, probably
      of cedar from Lebanon, the roof of their famous temple of Diana.<a
      href="#linknote-231" name="linknoteref-231" id="linknoteref-231">231</a>
      At present the wealth of Lebanon in cedars is not great, but the four
      hundred which form the grove near the source of the Kadisha, and the many
      scattered cedar woods in other places, are to be viewed as remnants of one
      great primeval forest, which originally covered all the upper slopes on
      the western side, and was composed, if not exclusively, at any rate
      predominantly, of cedars.<a href="#linknote-232" name="linknoteref-232"
       id="linknoteref-232">232</a> Cultivation, the need of fuel, and the wants
      of builders, have robbed the mountain of its primitive bright green vest,
      and left it either bare rock or terraced garden; but in the early times of
      Phoenicia, the true Lebanon cedar must undoubtedly have been its chief
      forest tree, and have stood to it as the pine to the Swiss Alps and the
      chestnut to the mountains of North Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of shrubs, below the rank of trees, the most important are the lentisk (<i>Pistachia
      lentiscus</i>), the bay, the arbutus (<i>A. andrachne</i>), the cypress,
      the oleander, the myrtle, the juniper, the barberry, the styrax (<i>S.
      officinalis</i>), the rhododendron, the bramble, the caper plant, the
      small-leaved holly, the prickly pear, the honeysuckle, and the jasmine.
      Myrtle and rhododendron grow luxuriantly on the flanks of Bargylus, and
      are more plentiful than any other shrubs in that region.<a
      href="#linknote-233" name="linknoteref-233" id="linknoteref-233">233</a>
      Eastern Lebanon has abundant scrub of juniper and barberry;<a
      href="#linknote-234" name="linknoteref-234" id="linknoteref-234">234</a>
      while on the western slopes their place is taken by the bramble, the
      myrtle, and the clematis.<a href="#linknote-235" name="linknoteref-235"
       id="linknoteref-235">235</a> The lentisk, which rarely exceeds the size of
      a low bush, is conspicuous by its dark evergreen leaves and numerous small
      red berries;<a href="#linknote-236" name="linknoteref-236"
       id="linknoteref-236">236</a> the arbutus&mdash;not our species, but a far
      lighter and more ornamental shrub, the <i>Arbutus andrachne</i>&mdash;bears
      also a bright red fruit, which colours the thickets;<a href="#linknote-237"
       name="linknoteref-237" id="linknoteref-237">237</a> the styrax, famous for
      yielding the gum storax of commerce, grows towards the east end of Carmel,
      and is a very large bush branching from the ground, but never assuming the
      form of a tree; it has small downy leaves, white flowers like orange
      blossoms, and round yellow fruit, pendulous from slender stalks, like
      cherries.<a href="#linknote-238" name="linknoteref-238"
       id="linknoteref-238">238</a> Travellers in Phoenicia do not often mention
      the caper plant, but it was seen by Canon Tristram hanging from the
      fissures of the rock, in the cleft of the Litany,<a href="#linknote-239"
       name="linknoteref-239" id="linknoteref-239">239</a> amid myrtle and bay
      and clematis. The small-leaved holly was noticed by Mr. Walpole on the
      western flank of Bargylus.<a href="#linknote-240" name="linknoteref-240"
       id="linknoteref-240">240</a> The prickly pear is not a native of Asia, but
      has been introduced from the New World. It has readily acclimatised
      itself, and is very generally employed, in Phoenicia, as in the
      neighbouring countries, for hedges.<a href="#linknote-241"
       name="linknoteref-241" id="linknoteref-241">241</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The fruit-trees of Phoenicia are numerous, and grow most luxuriantly, but
      the majority have no doubt been introduced from other countries, and the
      time of their introduction is uncertain. Five, however, may be reckoned as
      either indigenous or as cultivated at any rate from a remote antiquity&mdash;the
      vine, the olive, the date-palm, the walnut, and the fig. The vine is most
      widely spread. Vineyards cover large tracts in the vicinity of all the
      towns; they climb up the sides of Carmel, Lebanon, and Bargylus,<a
      href="#linknote-242" name="linknoteref-242" id="linknoteref-242">242</a>
      hang upon the edge of precipices, and greet the traveller at every turn in
      almost every region. The size of individual vines is extraordinary.
      &ldquo;Stephen Schultz states that in a village near Ptolemaïs (Acre) he supped
      under a large vine, the stem of which measured a foot and a half in
      diameter, its height being thirty feet; and that the whole plant,
      supported on trellis, covered an area of fifty feet either way. The
      bunches of grapes weighed from ten to twelve pounds and the berries were
      like small plums."<a href="#linknote-243" name="linknoteref-243"
       id="linknoteref-243">243</a> The olive in Phoenicia is at least as old as
      the Exodus, for it was said of Asher, who was assigned the more southern
      part of that country&mdash;&ldquo;Let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let
      him dip his foot in oil."<a href="#linknote-244" name="linknoteref-244"
       id="linknoteref-244">244</a> Olives at the present day clothe the slopes
      of Lebanon and Bargylus above the vine region,<a href="#linknote-245"
       name="linknoteref-245" id="linknoteref-245">245</a> and are carried upward
      almost to the very edge of the bare rock. They yield largely, and produce
      an oil of an excellent character. Fine olive-groves are also to be seen on
      Carmel,<a href="#linknote-246" name="linknoteref-246" id="linknoteref-246">246</a>
      in the neighbourhood of Esfia. The date-palm has already been spoken of as
      a tree, ornamenting the landscape and furnishing timber of tolerable
      quality. As a fruit-tree it is not greatly to be prized, since it is only
      about Haifa and Jaffa that it produces dates,<a href="#linknote-247"
       name="linknoteref-247" id="linknoteref-247">247</a> and those of no high
      repute. The walnut has all the appearance of being indigenous in Lebanon,
      where it grows to a great size,<a href="#linknote-248"
       name="linknoteref-248" id="linknoteref-248">248</a> and bears abundance of
      fruit. The fig is also, almost certainly, a native; it grows plentifully,
      not only in the orchards about towns, but on the flanks of Lebanon, on
      Bargylus, and in the northern Phoenician plain.<a href="#linknote-249"
       name="linknoteref-249" id="linknoteref-249">249</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The other fruit-trees of the present day are the mulberry, the
      pomegranate, the orange, the lemon, the lime, the peach, the apricot, the
      plum, the cherry, the quince, the apple, the pear, the almond, the
      pistachio nut, and the banana. The mulberry is cultivated largely on the
      Lebanon<a href="#linknote-250" name="linknoteref-250" id="linknoteref-250">250</a>
      in connection with the growth of silkworms, but is not valued as a
      fruit-tree. The pomegranate is far less often seen, but it is grown in the
      gardens about Saida,<a href="#linknote-251" name="linknoteref-251"
       id="linknoteref-251">251</a> and the fruit has sometimes been an article
      of exportation.<a href="#linknote-252" name="linknoteref-252"
       id="linknoteref-252">252</a> The orange and lemon are among the commonest
      fruits, but are generally regarded as comparatively late introductions.
      The lime is not often noticed, but obtains mention in the work of Mr.
      Walpole.<a href="#linknote-253" name="linknoteref-253" id="linknoteref-253">253</a>
      The peach and apricot are for the most part standard trees, though
      sometimes trained on trellises.<a href="#linknote-254"
       name="linknoteref-254" id="linknoteref-254">254</a> They were perhaps
      derived from Mesopotamia or Persia, but at what date it is quite
      impossible to conjecture. Apples, pears, plums, cherries, quinces, are not
      unlikely to have been indigenous, though of course the present species are
      the result of long and careful cultivation. The same may be said of the
      almond and the pistachio nut. The banana is a comparatively recent
      importation. It is grown along the coast from Jaffa as far north as
      Tripolis, and yields a fruit which is said to be of excellent quality.<a
      href="#linknote-255" name="linknoteref-255" id="linknoteref-255">255</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Altogether, Phoenicia may be pronounced a land of fruits. Hasselquist
      says,<a href="#linknote-256" name="linknoteref-256" id="linknoteref-256">256</a>
      that in his time Sidon grew pomegranates, apricots, figs, almonds,
      oranges, lemons, and plums in such abundance as to furnish annually
      several shiploads for export, while D&rsquo;Arvieux adds to this list pears,
      peaches, cherries, and bananas.<a href="#linknote-257"
       name="linknoteref-257" id="linknoteref-257">257</a> Lebanon alone can
      furnish grapes, olives, mulberries, figs, apples, apricots, walnuts,
      cherries, peaches, lemons, and oranges. The coast tract adds pomegranates,
      limes, and bananas. It has been said that Carmel, a portion of Phoenicia,
      is &ldquo;the garden of Eden run wild;"<a href="#linknote-258"
       name="linknoteref-258" id="linknoteref-258">258</a> but the phrase might
      be fitly applied to the entire country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of herbs possessing some value for man, Phoenicia produces sage, rosemary,
      lavender, rue, and wormwood.<a href="#linknote-259" name="linknoteref-259"
       id="linknoteref-259">259</a> Of flowers she has an extraordinary
      abundance. In early spring (March and April) not only the plains, but the
      very mountains, except where they consist of bare rock, are covered with a
      variegated carpet of the loveliest hues<a href="#linknote-260"
       name="linknoteref-260" id="linknoteref-260">260</a> from the floral wealth
      scattered over them. Bulbous plants are especially numerous. Travellers
      mention hyacinths, tulips, ranunculuses, gladioli, anemones, orchises,
      crocuses of several kinds&mdash;blue and yellow and white, arums,
      amaryllises, cyclamens, &amp;c., besides heaths, jasmine, honeysuckle,
      clematis, <i>multiflora</i> roses, rhododendrons, oleander, myrtle,
      astragalus, hollyhocks, convolvuli, valerian, red linum, pheasant&rsquo;s eye,
      guelder roses, antirrhinums, chrysanthemums, blue campanulas, and
      mandrakes. The orchises include &ldquo;<i>Ophrys atrata</i>, with its bee-like
      lip, another like the spider orchis, and a third like the man orchis;"<a
      href="#linknote-261" name="linknoteref-261" id="linknoteref-261">261</a>
      the cyclamens are especially beautiful, &ldquo;nestling under every stone and
      lavish of their loveliness with graceful tufts of blossoms varying in hue
      from purest white to deepest purple pink."<a href="#linknote-262"
       name="linknoteref-262" id="linknoteref-262">262</a> The multiflora rose is
      not common, but where it grows &ldquo;covers the banks of streams with a sheet
      of blossom;"<a href="#linknote-263" name="linknoteref-263"
       id="linknoteref-263">263</a> the oleanders fringe their waters with a line
      of ruby red; the mandrake (<i>Mandragora officinalis</i>) is &ldquo;one of the
      most striking plants of the country, with its flat disk of very broad
      primrose-like leaves, and its central bunch of dark blue bell-shaped
      blossom."<a href="#linknote-264" name="linknoteref-264"
       id="linknoteref-264">264</a> Ferns also abound, and among them is the
      delicate maidenhair.<a href="#linknote-265" name="linknoteref-265"

      The principal garden vegetables grown at the present day are melons,
      cucumbers, gourds, pumpkins, turnips, carrots, and radishes.<a
      href="#linknote-266" name="linknoteref-266" id="linknoteref-266">266</a>
      The kinds of grain most commonly cultivated are wheat, barley, millet, and
      maize. There is also an extensive cultivation of tobacco, indigo, and
      cotton, which have been introduced from abroad in comparatively modern
      times. Oil, silk, and fruits are, however, still among the chief articles
      of export; and the present wealth of the country is attributable mainly to
      its groves and orchards, its olives, mulberries, figs, lemons, and
      oranges.

      The zoology of Phoenicia has not until recently attracted very much
      attention. At present the list of land animals known to inhabit it is
      short,<a href="#linknote-267" name="linknoteref-267" id="linknoteref-267">267</a>
      including scarcely more than the bear, the leopard or panther, the wolf,
      the hyæna, the jackal, the fox, the hare, the wild boar, the ichneumon,
      the gazelle, the squirrel, the rat, and the mole. The present existence of
      the bear within the limits of the ancient Phoenicia has been questioned,<a
      href="#linknote-268" name="linknoteref-268" id="linknoteref-268">268</a>
      but the animal has been seen in Lebanon by Mr. Porter,<a
      href="#linknote-269" name="linknoteref-269" id="linknoteref-269">269</a>
      and in the mountains of Galilee by Canon Tristram.<a href="#linknote-270"
       name="linknoteref-270" id="linknoteref-270">270</a> The species is the
      Syrian bear (<i>Ursus syriacus</i>), a large and fierce beast, which,
      though generally frugivorous, will under the presser of hunger attack both
      men and animals. Its main habitat is, no doubt, the less accessible parts
      of Lebanon; but in the winter it will descend to the villages and gardens,
      where it often does much damage.<a href="#linknote-271"
       name="linknoteref-271" id="linknoteref-271">271</a> The panther or leopard
      has, like the bear, been seen by Mr. Porter in the Lebanon range;<a
      href="#linknote-272" name="linknoteref-272" id="linknoteref-272">272</a>
      and Canon Tristram, when visiting Carmel, was offered the skin of an adult
      leopard<a href="#linknote-273" name="linknoteref-273" id="linknoteref-273">273</a>
      which had probably been killed in that neighbourhood. Anciently it was
      much more frequent in Phoenicia and Palestine than it is at present, as
      appears by the numerous notices of it in Scripture.<a href="#linknote-274"
       name="linknoteref-274" id="linknoteref-274">274</a> Wolves, hyænas, and
      jackals are comparatively common. They haunt not only Carmel and Lebanon,
      but many portions of the coast tract. Canon Tristram obtained from Carmel
      &ldquo;the two largest hyænas that he had ever seen,"<a href="#linknote-275"
       name="linknoteref-275" id="linknoteref-275">275</a> and fell in with
      jackals in the vicinity.<a href="#linknote-276" name="linknoteref-276"
       id="linknoteref-276">276</a> Wolves seem to be more scarce, though
      anciently very plentiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The favourite haunts of the wild boar (<i>Sus scrofa</i>) in Phoenicia are
      Carmel<a href="#linknote-277" name="linknoteref-277" id="linknoteref-277">277</a>
      and the deep valleys on the western slope of Lebanon. The valley of the
      Adonis (Ibrahim) is still noted for them,<a href="#linknote-278"
       name="linknoteref-278" id="linknoteref-278">278</a> but, except on Carmel,
      they are not very abundant. Foxes and hares are also somewhat rare, and it
      is doubtful whether rabbits are to be found in any part of the country;<a
      href="#linknote-279" name="linknoteref-279" id="linknoteref-279">279</a>
      ichneumons, which are tolerably common, seem sometimes to be mistaken for
      them. Gazelles are thought to inhabit Carmel,<a href="#linknote-280"
       name="linknoteref-280" id="linknoteref-280">280</a> and squirrels, rats,
      and moles are common. Bats also, if they may be counted among
      land-animals, are frequent; they belong, it is probable, to several
      species, one of which is <i>Xantharpyia ægyptiaca</i>.<a
      href="#linknote-281" name="linknoteref-281" id="linknoteref-281">281</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      If the fauna of Phoenicia is restricted so far as land-animals are
      concerned, it is extensive and varied in respect of birds. The list of
      known birds includes two sorts of eagle (<i>Circaëtos gallicus</i> and <i>Aquila
      nævioïdes</i>), the osprey, the vulture, the falcon, the kite, the
      honey-buzzard, the marsh-harrier, the sparrow-hawk, owls of two kinds (<i>Ketupa
      ceylonensis</i> and <i>Athene meridionalis</i>), the grey shrike (<i>Lanius
      excubitor</i>), the common cormorant, the pigmy cormorant (<i>Græculus
      pygmæus</i>), numerous seagulls, as the Adriatic gull (<i>Larus
      melanocephalus</i>), Andonieri&rsquo;s gull, the herring-gull, the Red-Sea-gull
      (<i>Larus ichthyo-aëtos</i>), and others; the gull-billed tern (<i>Sterna
      anglica</i>), the Egyptian goose, the wild duck, the woodcock, the Greek
      partridge (<i>Caccabis saxatilis</i>), the waterhen, the corncrake or
      landrail, the coot, the water-ouzel, the francolin; plovers of three
      kinds, green, golden, and Kentish; dotterels of two kinds, red-throated
      and Asiatic; the Manx shearwater, the flamingo, the heron, the common
      kingfisher, and the black and white kingfisher of Egypt, the jay, the
      wood-pigeon, the rock-dove, the blue thrush, the Egyptian fantail (<i>Drymoeca
      gracilis</i>), the redshank, the wheat-ear (<i>Saxicola libanotica</i>),
      the common lark, the Persian horned lark, the cisticole, the yellow-billed
      Alpine chough, the nightingale of the East (<i>Ixos xanthopygius</i>), the
      robin, the brown linnet, the chaffinch; swallows of two kinds (<i>Hirundo
      cahirica</i> and <i>Hirundo rufula</i>); the meadow bunting; the Lebanon
      redstart, the common and yellow water-wagtails, the chiffchaff, the
      coletit, the Russian tit, the siskin, the nuthatch, and the willow wren.
      Of these the most valuable for the table are the partridge, the francolin,
      and the woodcock. The Greek partridge is &ldquo;a fine red-legged bird, much
      larger than our red-legged partridge, and very much better eating, with
      white flesh, and nearly as heavy as a pheasant."<a href="#linknote-282"
       name="linknoteref-282" id="linknoteref-282">282</a> The francolin or black
      partridge is also a delicacy; and the woodcock, which is identical with
      our own, has the same delicate flavour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fish of Phoenicia, excepting certain shell-fish, are little known, and
      have seldom attracted the attention of travellers. The Mediterranean,
      however, where it washes the Phoenician coast, can furnish excellent
      mullet,<a href="#linknote-283" name="linknoteref-283" id="linknoteref-283">283</a>
      while most of the rivers contain freshwater fish of several kinds, as the
      <i>Blennius lupulus</i>, the <i>Scaphiodon capoëta</i>, and the <i>Anguilla
      microptera</i>.<a href="#linknote-284" name="linknoteref-284"
       id="linknoteref-284">284</a> All of these fish may be eaten, but the
      quality is inferior.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, to certain of the shell-fish of Phoenicia a great
      celebrity attaches. The purple dye which gave to the textile fabrics of
      the Phoenicians a world-wide reputation was prepared from certain
      shell-fish which abounded upon their coast. Four existing species have
      been regarded as more or less employed in the manufacture, and it seems to
      be certain, at any rate, that the Phoenicians derived the dye from more
      shell-fish than one. The four are the <i>Buccinum lapillus</i> of Pliny,<a
      href="#linknote-285" name="linknoteref-285" id="linknoteref-285">285</a>
      which is the <i>Purpura lapillus</i> of modern naturalists; the <i>Murex
      trunculus</i>; the <i>Murex brandaris</i>; and the <i>Helix ianthina</i>.
      The Buccinum derives its name from the form of the shell, which has a wide
      mouth, like that of a trumpet, and which after one or two twists
      terminates in a pointed head.<a href="#linknote-286" name="linknoteref-286"
       id="linknoteref-286">286</a> The <i>Murex trunculus</i> has the same
      general form as the Buccinum; but the shell is more rough and spinous,
      being armed with a number of long thin projections which terminate in a
      sharp point.<a href="#linknote-287" name="linknoteref-287"
       id="linknoteref-287">287</a> The <i>Murex brandaris</i> is a closely
      allied species, and &ldquo;one of the most plentiful on the Phoenician coast."<a
      href="#linknote-288" name="linknoteref-288" id="linknoteref-288">288</a>
      It is unlikely that the ancients regarded it as a different shell from <i>Murex
      trunculus</i>. The <i>Helix ianthina</i> has a wholly different character.
      It is a sort of sea-snail, as the name <i>helix</i> implies, is perfectly
      smooth, &ldquo;very delicate and fragile, and not more than about three-quarters
      of an inch in diameter."<a href="#linknote-289" name="linknoteref-289"
       id="linknoteref-289">289</a> All these shell-fish contain a <i>sac</i> or
      bag full of colouring matter, which is capable of being used as a dye. It
      is quite possible that they were all, more or less, made use of by the
      Phoenician dyers; but the evidence furnished by existing remains on the
      Tyrian coast is strongly in favour of the <i>Murex brandaris</i> as the
      species principally employed.<a href="#linknote-290" name="linknoteref-290"
       id="linknoteref-290">290</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The mineral treasures of Phoenicia have not, in modern times, been
      examined with any care. The Jura limestone, which forms the substratum of
      the entire region, cannot be expected to yield any important mineral
      products. But the sandstone, which overlies it in places, is &ldquo;often
      largely impregnated with iron,&rdquo; and some strata towards the southern end
      of Lebanon are said to produce &ldquo;as much as ninety per cent. of pure iron
      ore."<a href="#linknote-291" name="linknoteref-291" id="linknoteref-291">291</a>
      An ochrous earth is also found in the hills above Beyrout, which gives
      from fifty to sixty per cent. of metal.<a href="#linknote-292"
       name="linknoteref-292" id="linknoteref-292">292</a> Coal, too, has been
      found in the same locality, but it is of bad quality, and does not exist
      in sufficient quantity to form an important product. Limestone, both
      cretaceous and siliceous, is plentiful, as are sandstone, trap and basalt;
      while porphyry and greenstone are also obtainable.<a href="#linknote-293"
       name="linknoteref-293" id="linknoteref-293">293</a> Carmel yields crystals
      of quarts and chalcedony,<a href="#linknote-294" name="linknoteref-294"
       id="linknoteref-294">294</a> and the fine sand about Tyre and Sidon is
      still such as would make excellent glass. But the main productions of
      Phoenicia, in which its natural wealth consisted, must always have been
      vegetable, rather than animal or mineral, and have consisted in its
      timber, especially its cedars and pines; its fruits, as olives, figs,
      grapes, and, in early times, dates; and its garden vegetables, melons,
      gourds, pumpkins, cucumbers.

</pre>
    <p>
      The Phoenician people are generally admitted to have belonged to the group
      of nations known as Semitic. This group, somewhat irrelevantly named,
      since the descent of several of them from Shem is purely problematic,
      comprises the Assyrians, the later Babylonians, the Aramæans or Syrians,
      the Arabians, the Moabites, the Phoenicians, and the Hebrews. A single and
      very marked type of language belongs to the entire group, and a character
      of homogeneity may, with certain distinctions, be observed among all the
      various members composing it. The unity of language is threefold: it may
      be traced in the roots, in the inflections, and in the general features of
      the syntax. The roots are, as a rule, bilateral or trilateral, composed
      (that is) of two or three letters, all of which are consonants. The
      consonants determine the general sense of the words, and are alone
      expressed in the primitive writing; the vowel sounds do but modify more or
      less the general sense, and are unexpressed until the languages begin to
      fall into decay. The roots are, almost all of them, more or less physical
      and sensuous. They are derived in general from an imitation of nature. &ldquo;If
      one looked only to the Semitic languages,&rdquo; says M. Renan,<a
      href="#linknote-31" name="linknoteref-31" id="linknoteref-31">31</a> &ldquo;one
      would say, that sensation alone presided over the first acts of the human
      intellect, and that language was primarily nothing but a mere reflex of
      the external world. If we run through the list of Semitic roots, we
      scarcely meet with a single one which does not present to us a sense
      primarily material, which is then transferred, by transitions more or less
      direct and immediate, to things which are intellectual.&rdquo; Derivative words
      are formed from the roots by a few simple and regular laws. The noun is
      scarcely inflected at all; but the verb has a marvellous wealth of
      conjugations, calculated to express excellently well the external
      relations of ideas, but altogether incapable of expressing their
      metaphysical relations, from the want of definitely marked tenses and
      moods. Inflections in general have a half-agglutinative character, the
      meaning and origin of the affixes and suffixes being palpable. Syntax
      scarcely exists, the construction of sentences having such a general
      character of simplicity, especially in narrative, that one might compare
      it with the naïve utterances of an infant. The utmost endeavour of the
      Semites is to join words together so as to form a sentence; to join
      sentences is an effort altogether beyond them. They employ the {lexis
      eiromene} of Aristotle,<a href="#linknote-32" name="linknoteref-32"
       id="linknoteref-32">32</a> which proceeds by accumulating atom on atom,
      instead of attempting the rounded period of the Latins and Greeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The common traits of character among Semitic nations have been summed up
      by one writer under five heads:&mdash;1. Pliability combined with iron
      fixity of purpose; 2. Depth and force; 3. A yearning for dreamy ease; 4.
      Capacity for the hardest work; and 5. Love of abstract thought.<a
      href="#linknote-33" name="linknoteref-33" id="linknoteref-33">33</a>
      Another has thought to find them in the following list:&mdash;1. An
      intuitive monotheism; 2. Intolerance; 3. Prophetism; 4. Want of the
      philisophic and scientific faculties; 5. Want of curiosity; 6. Want of
      appreciation of mimetic art; 7. Want of capacity for true political life.<a
      href="#linknote-34" name="linknoteref-34" id="linknoteref-34">34</a>
      According to the latter writer, &ldquo;the Semitic race is to be recognized
      almost entirely by negative characteristics; it has no mythology, no epic
      poetry, no science, no philosophy, no fiction, no plastic arts, no civil
      life; everywhere it shows absence of complexity; absence of combination;
      an exclusive sentiment of unity."<a href="#linknote-35"
       name="linknoteref-35" id="linknoteref-35">35</a> It is not very easy to
      reconcile these two views, and not very satisfactory to regard a race as
      &ldquo;characterised by negatives.&rdquo; Agreement should consist in positive
      features, and these may perhaps be found, first, in strength and depth of
      the religious feeling, combined with firm belief in the personality of the
      Deity; secondly, in dogged determination and &ldquo;iron fixity of purpose;&rdquo;
       thirdly, in inventiveness and skill in the mechanical arts and other
      industries; fourthly, in &ldquo;capacity for hard work;&rdquo; and, fifthly, in a
      certain adaptability and pliability, suiting the race for expansion and
      for commerce. All these qualities are perhaps not conspicuous in all the
      branches of the Semites, but the majority of them will be found united in
      all, and in some the combination would seem to be complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is primarily on account of their language that the Phoenicians are
      regarded as Semites. When there are no historical grounds for believing
      that a nation has laid aside its own original form of speech, and adopted
      an alien dialect, language, if not a certain, is at least a very strong,
      evidence of ethnic character. Counter-evidence may no doubt rebut the <i>prima
      facie</i> presumption; but in the case of the Phoenicians no
      counter-evidence is producible. They belong to exactly that geographic
      zone in which Semitism has always had its chief seat; they cannot be shown
      to have been ever so circumstanced as to have had any inducement to change
      their speech; and their physical character and mental characteristics
      would, by themselves, be almost sufficient ground for assigning them to
      the type whereto their language points.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place which the Phoenicians occupy within the Semitic group is a
      question considerably more difficult to determine. By local position they
      should belong to the western, or Aramaic branch, rather than to the
      eastern, or Assyro-Babylonian, or to the southern, or Arab. But the
      linguistic evidence scarcely lends itself to such a view, while the
      historic leads decidedly to an opposite conclusion. There is a far closer
      analogy between the Palestinian group of languages&mdash;Phoenician,
      Hebrew, Moabite, and the Assyro-Babylonian, than between either of these
      and the Aramaic. The Aramaic is scanty both in variety of grammatical
      forms and in vocabulary; the Phoenician and Assyro-Babylonian are
      comparatively copious.<a href="#linknote-36" name="linknoteref-36"
       id="linknoteref-36">36</a> The Aramaic has the character of a degraded
      language; the Assyro-Babylonian and the Phoenician are modelled on a
      primitive type.<a href="#linknote-37" name="linknoteref-37"
       id="linknoteref-37">37</a> In some respects Phoenician is even closer to
      Assyro-Babylonian than Hebrew is&mdash;e.g. in preferring <i>at</i> to <i>ah</i>
      for the feminine singular termination.<a href="#linknote-38"
       name="linknoteref-38" id="linknoteref-38">38</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The testimony of history to the origin of the Phoenicians is the
      following. Herodotus tells us that both the Phoenicians themselves, and
      the Persians best acquainted with history and antiquities, agreed in
      stating that the original settlements of the Phoenician people were upon
      the Erythræan Sea (Persian Gulf), and that they had migrated from that
      quarter at a remote period, and transferred their abode to the shores of
      the Mediterranean.<a href="#linknote-39" name="linknoteref-39"
       id="linknoteref-39">39</a> Strabo adds that the inhabitants of certain
      islands in the Persian Gulf had a similar tradition, and showed temples in
      their cities which were Phoenician in character.<a href="#linknote-310"
       name="linknoteref-310" id="linknoteref-310">310</a> Justin, or rather
      Trogus Pompeius, whom he abbreviated, writes as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The Syrian
      nation was founded by the Phoenicians, who, being disturbed by an
      earthquake, left their native land, and settled first of all in the
      neighbourhood of the Assyrian Lake, and subsequently on the shore of the
      Mediterranean, where they built a city which they called Sidon on account
      of the abundance of the fish; for the Phoenicians call a fish <i>sidon</i>."<a
      href="#linknote-311" name="linknoteref-311" id="linknoteref-311">311</a>
      The &ldquo;Assyrian lake&rdquo; of this passage is probably the Bahr Nedjif, or &ldquo;Sea
      of Nedjif,&rdquo; in the neighbourhood of the ancient Babylon, a permanent sheet
      of water, varying in its dimensions at different seasons, but generally
      about forty miles long, and from ten to twenty broad.<a
      href="#linknote-312" name="linknoteref-312" id="linknoteref-312">312</a>
      Attempts have been made to discredit this entire story, but the highest
      living authority on the subject of Phoenicia and the Phoenicians adopts it
      as almost certainly true, and observes:&mdash;&ldquo;The tradition relative to
      the sojourn of the Phoenicians on the borders of the Erythræan Sea, before
      their establishment on the coast of the Mediterranean, has thus a new
      light thrown upon it. It appears from the labours of M. Movers, and from
      the recent discoveries made at Nineveh and Babylon, that the civilisation
      and religion of Phoenicia and Assyria were very similar. Independently of
      this, the majority of modern critics admit it as demonstrated that the
      primitive abode of the Phoenicians ought to be placed upon the Lower
      Euphrates, in the midst of the great commercial and maritime
      establishments of the Persian Gulf, agreeable to the unanimous witness of
      all antiquity."<a href="#linknote-313" name="linknoteref-313"
       id="linknoteref-313">313</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      If we pass from the probable origin of the Phoenician people, and their
      place in the Semitic group, to their own special characteristics, we shall
      find ourselves upon surer ground, though even here there are certain
      points which are debateable. The following is the account of their general
      character given by a very high authority, and by one who, on the whole,
      may be regarded as an admirer:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Phoenicians form, in some respects, the most important fraction of
      the whole group of antique nations, notwithstanding that they sprang from
      the most obscure and insignificant families. This fraction, when settled,
      was constantly exposed to inroad by new tribes, was utterly conquered and
      subjected by utter strangers when it had taken a great place among the
      nations, and yet by industry, by perseverance, by acuteness of intellect,
      by unscrupulousness and wait of faith, by adaptability and pliability when
      necessary, and dogged defiance at other times, by total disregard of the
      rights of the weaker, they obtained the foremost place in the history of
      their times, and the highest reputation, not only for the things that they
      did, but for many that they did not. They were the first systematic
      traders, the first miners and metallurgists, the greatest inventors (if we
      apply such a term to those who kept an ever-watchful lookout for the
      inventions of others, and immediately applied them to themselves with some
      grand improvements on the original idea); they were the boldest mariners,
      the greatest colonisers, who at one time held not only the gorgeous East,
      but the whole of the then half-civilised West in fee&mdash;who could boast
      of a form of government approaching to constitutionalism, who of all
      nations of the time stood highest in practical arts and sciences, and into
      whose laps there flowed an unceasing stream of the world&rsquo;s entire riches,
      until the day came when they began to care for nothing else, and the
      enjoyment of material comforts and luxuries took the place of the thirst
      for and search after knowledge. Their piratical prowess and daring was
      undermined; their colonies, grown old enough to stand alone, fell away
      from them, some after a hard fight, others in mutual agreement or
      silently; and the nations in whose estimation and fear they had held the
      first place, and who had been tributary to them, disdained them, ignored
      them, and finally struck them utterly out of the list of nations, till
      they dwindled away miserably, a warning to all who should come after
      them."<a href="#linknote-314" name="linknoteref-314" id="linknoteref-314">314</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The prominent qualities in this description would seem to be industry and
      perseverance, audacity in enterprise, adaptability and pliability,
      acuteness of intellect, unscrupulousness, and want of good faith. The
      Phoenicians were certainly among the most industrious and persevering of
      mankind. The accounts which we have of them from various quarters, and the
      remains which cover the country that they once inhabited, sufficiently
      attest their unceasing and untiring activity through almost the whole
      period of their existence as a nation. Always labouring in their workshops
      at home in mechanical and æsthetic arts, they were at the same time
      constantly seeking employment abroad, ransacking the earth for useful or
      beautiful commodities, building cities, constructing harbours, founding
      colonies, introducing the arts of life among wild nations, mining and
      establishing fisheries, organising lines of land traffic, perpetually
      moving from place to place, and leaving wherever they went abundant proofs
      of their diligence and capacity for hard work. From Thasos in the East,
      where Herodotus saw &ldquo;a large mountain turned topsy-turvy by the
      Phoenicians in their search for gold,"<a href="#linknote-315"
       name="linknoteref-315" id="linknoteref-315">315</a> to the Scilly Islands
      in the West, where workings attributable to them are still to be seen, all
      the metalliferous islands and coast tracts bear traces of Phoenician
      industry in tunnels, adits, and air-shafts, while manufactured vessels of
      various kinds in silver, bronze, and terra-cotta, together with figures
      and gems of a Phoenician type, attest still more widely their
      manufacturing and commercial activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audacity in enterprise can certainly not be denied to the adventurous race
      which, from the islands and coasts of the Eastern Mediterranean, launched
      forth upon the unknown sea in fragile ships, affronted the perils of waves
      and storms, and still more dreaded &ldquo;monsters of the deep,"<a
      href="#linknote-316" name="linknoteref-316" id="linknoteref-316">316</a>
      explored the recesses of the stormy Adriatic and inhospitable Pontus,
      steered their perilous course amid all the islets and rocks of the Ægean,
      along the iron-bound shores of Thrace, Euboea, and Laconia, first into the
      Western Mediterranean basin, and then through the Straits of Gibraltar
      into the wild and boundless Atlantic, with its mighty tides, its huge
      rollers, its blinding rains, and its frequent fogs. Without a chart,
      without a compass, guided only in their daring voyages by their knowledge
      of the stars, these bold mariners penetrated to the shores of Scythia in
      one direction; to Britain, if not even to the Baltic, in another; in a
      third to the Fortunate Islands; while, in a fourth, they traversed the
      entire length of the Red Sea, and entering upon the Southern Ocean,
      succeeded in doubling the Cape of Storms two thousand years before Vasco
      di Gama, and in effecting the circumnavigation of Africa.<a
      href="#linknote-317" name="linknoteref-317" id="linknoteref-317">317</a>
      And, wild as the seas were with which they had to deal, they had to deal
      with yet wilder men. Except in Egypt, Asia Minor, Greece, and perhaps
      Italy, they came in contact everywhere with savage races; they had to
      enter into close relations with men treacherous, bloodthirsty, covetous&mdash;men
      who were almost always thieves, who were frequently cannibals, sometimes
      wreckers&mdash;who regarded foreigners as a cheap and very delicious kind
      of food. The pioneers of civilisation, always and everywhere, incur
      dangers from which ordinary mortals would shrink with dismay; but the
      earliest pioneers, the first introducers of the elements of culture among
      barbarians who had never heard of it, must have encountered far greater
      peril than others from their ignorance of the ways of savage man, and a
      want of those tremendous weapons of attack and defence with which modern
      explorers take care to provide themselves. Until the invention of
      gunpowder, the arms of civilised men&mdash;swords, and spears, and
      javelins, and the like&mdash;were scarcely a match for the cunningly
      devised weapons&mdash;boomerangs, and blow-pipes, and poisoned arrows, and
      lassoes<a href="#linknote-318" name="linknoteref-318" id="linknoteref-318">318</a>&mdash;of
      the savage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The adaptability and pliability of the Phoenicians was especially shown in
      their power of obtaining the favourable regard of almost all the peoples
      and nations with which they came into contact, whether civilised or
      uncivilised. It is most remarkable that the Egyptians, intolerant as they
      usually were of strangers, should have allowed the Phoenicians to settle
      in their southern capital, Memphis, and to build a temple and inhabit a
      quarter there.<a href="#linknote-319" name="linknoteref-319"
       id="linknoteref-319">319</a> It is also curious and interesting that the
      Phoenicians should have been able to ingratiate themselves with another
      most exclusive and self-sufficing people, viz. the Jews. Hiram&rsquo;s friendly
      dealings with David and Solomon are well known; but the <i>continued</i>
      alliance between the Phoenicians and the Israelites has attracted less
      attention. Solomon took wives from Phoenicia;<a href="#linknote-320"
       name="linknoteref-320" id="linknoteref-320">320</a> Ahab married the
      daughter of Ithobalus, king of Sidon;<a href="#linknote-321"
       name="linknoteref-321" id="linknoteref-321">321</a> Phoenicia furnished
      timber for the second Temple;<a href="#linknote-322" name="linknoteref-322"
       id="linknoteref-322">322</a> Isaiah wound up his prophecy against Tyre
      with a consolation;<a href="#linknote-323" name="linknoteref-323"
       id="linknoteref-323">323</a> our Lord found faith in the Syro-Phoenician
      woman;<a href="#linknote-324" name="linknoteref-324" id="linknoteref-324">324</a>
      in the days of Herod Agrippa, Tyre and Sidon still desired peace with
      Judæa, &ldquo;because their country was nourished by the king&rsquo;s country."<a
      href="#linknote-325" name="linknoteref-325" id="linknoteref-325">325</a>
      And similarly Tyre had friendly relations with Syria and Greece, with
      Mesopotamia and Assyria, with Babylonia and Chaldæa. At the same time she
      could bend herself to meet the wants and gain the confidence of all the
      varieties of barbarians, the rude Armenians, the wild Arabs, the barbarous
      tribes of northern and western Africa, the rough Iberi, the passionate
      Gauls, the painted Britons, the coarse Sards, the fierce Thracians, the
      filthy Scyths, the savage races of the Caucasus. Tribes so timid and
      distrustful as those of Tropical Africa were lured into peaceful and
      friendly relations by the artifice of a &ldquo;dumb commerce,"<a
      href="#linknote-326" name="linknoteref-326" id="linknoteref-326">326</a>
      and on every side untamed man was softened and drawn towards civilisation
      by a spirit of accommodation, conciliation, and concession to prejudices.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Phoenicians are to be credited with acuteness of intellect, it must
      be limited to the field of practical enquiry and discovery. Whatever may
      be said with regard to the extent and variety of their literature&mdash;a
      subject which will be treated in another chapter&mdash;it cannot be
      pretended that humanity owes to them any important conquests of a
      scientific or philosophic character. Herodotus, who admires the learning
      of the Persians,<a href="#linknote-327" name="linknoteref-327"
       id="linknoteref-327">327</a> the science of the Babylonians,<a
      href="#linknote-328" name="linknoteref-328" id="linknoteref-328">328</a>
      and the combined learning and science of the Egyptians,<a
      href="#linknote-329" name="linknoteref-329" id="linknoteref-329">329</a>
      limits his commendation of the Phoenicians to their skill in navigation,
      in mechanics, and in works of art.<a href="#linknote-330"
       name="linknoteref-330" id="linknoteref-330">330</a> Had they made advances
      in the abstract, or even in the mixed, sciences, in mathematics, or
      astronomy, or geometry, in logic or metaphysics, either their writings
      would have been preserved, or at least the Greeks would have made
      acknowledgments of being indebted to them.<a href="#linknote-331"
       name="linknoteref-331" id="linknoteref-331">331</a> But it is only in the
      field of practical matters that any such acknowledgments are made. The
      Greeks allow themselves to have been indebted to the Phoenicians for
      alphabetic writing, for advances in metallurgy, for improvements in
      shipbuilding, and navigation, for much geographic knowledge, for exquisite
      dyes, and for the manufacture of glass. There can be no doubt that the
      Phoenicians were a people of great practical ability, with an intellect
      quick to devise means to ends, to scheme, contrive, and execute, and with
      a happy knack of perceiving what was practically valuable in the
      inventions of other nations, and of appropriating them to their own use,
      often with improvements upon the original idea. But they were not
      possessed of any great genius or originality. They were, on the whole,
      adapters rather than inventors. They owed their idea of alphabetic writing
      to the Accadians,<a href="#linknote-332" name="linknoteref-332"
       id="linknoteref-332">332</a> their weights and measures to Babylon,<a
      href="#linknote-333" name="linknoteref-333" id="linknoteref-333">333</a>
      their shipbuilding probably to Egypt,<a href="#linknote-334"
       name="linknoteref-334" id="linknoteref-334">334</a> their early
      architecture to the same country,<a href="#linknote-335"
       name="linknoteref-335" id="linknoteref-335">335</a> their mimetic art to
      Assyria, to Egypt, and to Greece. They were not poets, or painters, or
      sculptors, or great architects, much less philosophers or scientists; but
      in the practical arts, and even in the practical sciences, they held a
      high place, in almost all of them equalling, and in some exceeding, all
      their neighbours.
    </p>
    <p>
      We should be inclined also to assign to the Phoenicians, as a special
      characteristic, a peculiar capacity for business. This may be said,
      indeed, to be nothing more than acuteness of intellect applied in a
      particular way. To ourselves, however, it appears to be, in some sort, a
      special gift. As, beyond all question, there are many persons of extremely
      acute intellect who have not the slightest turn for business, or ability
      for dealing with it, so we think there are nations, to whom no one would
      deny high intellectual power, without the capacity in question. In its
      most perfect form it has belonged but to a small number of nations&mdash;to
      the Phoenicians, the Venetians, the Genoese, the English, and the Dutch.
      It implies, not so much high intellectual power, as a combination of
      valuable, yet not very admirable, qualities of a lower order. Industry,
      perseverance, shrewdness, quickness of perception, power of forecasting
      the future, power of organisation, boldness, promptness, are among the
      qualities needed, and there may be others discoverable by the skilful
      analyst. All these met in the Phoenicians, and met in the proportions that
      were needed for the combination to take full effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether unscrupulousness and want of good faith are rightly assigned to
      the Phoenicians as characteristic traits, is, at the least, open to doubt.
      The Latin writers, with whom the reproach contained in the expression
      &ldquo;Punica fides&rdquo; originated, are scarcely to be accepted as unprejudiced
      witnesses, since it is in most instances a necessity that they should
      either impute &ldquo;bad faith&rdquo; to the opposite side, or admit that there was
      &ldquo;bad faith&rdquo; on their own. The aspersions of an enemy are entitled to
      little weight. The cry of &ldquo;perfide Albion&rdquo; is often heard in the land of
      one of our near neighbours; but few Englishmen will admit the justice of
      it. It may be urged in favour of the Phoenicians that long-continued
      commercial success is impossible without fair-dealing and honesty; that
      where there is commercial fair-dealing and honesty, those qualities become
      part and parcel of the national character, and determine national policy;
      and, further, that in almost every one of the instances of bad faith
      alleged, there is at the least a doubt, of which the accused party ought
      to have the benefit. At any rate, let it be remembered that the charges
      made affect the Liby-Phoenicians alone, and not the Phoenicians of Asia,
      with whom we are here primarily concerned, and that we cannot safely, or
      equitably, transfer to a mother-country faults which are only even alleged
      against one of her colonies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Physically, the Phoenicians appear to have resembled the Assyrians and the
      Jews. They had large frames strongly made, well-developed muscles, curled
      beards, and abundant hair. In their features they may have borne a
      resemblance, but probably not a very strong resemblance, to the Cypriots,<a
      href="#linknote-336" name="linknoteref-336" id="linknoteref-336">336</a>
      who were a mixed people recruited from various quarters.<a
      href="#linknote-337" name="linknoteref-337" id="linknoteref-337">337</a>
      In complexion they belonged to the white race, but were rather sallow than
      fair. Their hair was generally dark, though it may have been sometimes
      red. Some have regarded the name &ldquo;Phoenician&rdquo; as indicating that they were
      of a red or red-brown colour;<a href="#linknote-338" name="linknoteref-338"
       id="linknoteref-338">338</a> but it is better to regard the appellation as
      having passed from the country to its people, and as applied to the
      country by the Greeks on account of the palm-trees which grew along its
      shores.

      CHAPTER IV&mdash;THE CITIES
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Importance of the cities in Phoenicia&mdash;Their names and
     relative eminence&mdash;Cities of the first rank&mdash;Sidon&mdash;Tyre&mdash;
     Arvad or Aradus&mdash;Marathus&mdash;Gebal or Byblus&mdash;Tripolis&mdash;Cities
     of the second rank&mdash;Aphaca&mdash;Berytus&mdash;Arka&mdash;Ecdippa&mdash;Accho&mdash;
     Dor&mdash;Japho or Joppa&mdash;Ramantha or Laodicea&mdash;Fivefold division
     of Phoenicia.
</pre>
    <p>
      Phoenicia, like Greece, was a country where the cities held a position of
      extreme importance. The nation was not a centralised one, with a single
      recognised capital, like Judæa, or Samaria, or Syria, or Assyria, or
      Babylonia. It was, like Greece, a congeries of homogeneous tribes, who had
      never been amalgamated into a single political entity, and who clung
      fondly to the idea of separate independence. Tyre and Sidon are often
      spoken of as if they were metropolitical cities; but it may be doubted
      whether there was ever a time when either of them could claim even a
      temporary authority over the whole country. Each, no doubt, from time to
      time, exercised a sort of hegemony over a certain number of the inferior
      cities; but there was no organised confederacy, no obligation of any one
      city to submit to another, and no period, as far as our knowledge extends,
      at which all the cities acknowledged a single one as their mistress.<a
      href="#linknote-41" name="linknoteref-41" id="linknoteref-41">41</a>
      Between Tyre and Sidon there was especial jealousy, and the acceptance by
      either of the leadership of the other, even temporarily, was a rare fact
      in the history of the nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the geographers, the cities of Phoenicia, from Laodicea in
      the extreme north to Joppa at the extreme south, numbered about
      twenty-five. These were Laodicea, Gabala, Balanea, Paltos; Aradus, with
      its dependency Antaradus; Marathus; Simyra, Orthosia, and Arka; Tripolis,
      Calamus, Trieris, and Botrys; Byblus or Gebal; Aphaca; Berytus; Sidon,
      Sarepta, and Ornithonpolis; Tyre and Ecdippa; Accho and Porphyreon; Dor
      and Joppa. Of the twenty-five a certain number were, historically and
      politically, insignificant; for instance, Gabala, Balanea, Paltos,
      Orthosia, Calamus, Trieris, Botrys, Sarepta, Ornithonpolis, Porphyreon.
      Sarepta is immortalised by the memory of its pious widow,<a
      href="#linknote-42" name="linknoteref-42" id="linknoteref-42">42</a> and
      Orthosia has a place in history from its connection with the adventures of
      Trypho;<a href="#linknote-43" name="linknoteref-43" id="linknoteref-43">43</a>
      but the rest of the list are little more than &ldquo;geographical expressions.&rdquo;
       There remain fifteen important cities, of which six may be placed in the
      first rank and nine in the second&mdash;the six being Tyre, Sidon, Aradus,
      Byblus or Gebal, Marathus, and Tripolis; the nine, Laodicea, Simyra, Arka,
      Aphaca, Berytus, Ecdippa, Accho, Dor, and Joppa. It will be sufficient in
      the present place to give some account of these fifteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some grounds for considering Sidon to have been the most ancient
      of the Phoenician towns. In the Book of Genesis Sidon is called &ldquo;the
      eldest born of Canaan,"<a href="#linknote-44" name="linknoteref-44"
       id="linknoteref-44">44</a> and in Joshua, where Tyre is simply a &ldquo;fenced
      city&rdquo; or fort,<a href="#linknote-45" name="linknoteref-45"
       id="linknoteref-45">45</a> it is &ldquo;<i>Great</i> Zidon."<a
      href="#linknote-46" name="linknoteref-46" id="linknoteref-46">46</a> Homer
      frequently mentions it,<a href="#linknote-47" name="linknoteref-47"
       id="linknoteref-47">47</a> whereas he takes no notice of Tyre. Justin
      makes it the first town which the Phoenicians built on arriving at the
      shores of the Mediterranean.<a href="#linknote-48" name="linknoteref-48"
       id="linknoteref-48">48</a> The priority of Sidon in this respect was,
      however, not universally acknowledged, since Tyre claims on some of her
      coins to have been &ldquo;the mother-city of the Sidonians,"<a
      href="#linknote-49" name="linknoteref-49" id="linknoteref-49">49</a> and
      Marathus was also regarded as a city of the very highest antiquity.<a
      href="#linknote-410" name="linknoteref-410" id="linknoteref-410">410</a>
      The city stood in Lat. 33º 34´ nearly, on the flat plain between the
      mountains and the shore, opposite a small promontory which projects into
      the sea towards the west, and is flanked towards the north-west and north
      by a number of rocky islands. The modern town of Saïda stands close upon
      the shore, occupying the greater part of the peninsula and a portion of
      the plain on which it abuts; but the ancient city is found to have been
      situated entirely in the plain, and its most western traces are almost
      half a mile from the nearest point of the present walls.<a

      The modern Saïda has clustered itself about what was the principal port of
      the ancient town, which lay north of the promontory, and was well
      protected from winds, on the west by the principal island, which has a
      length of 250 yards, and on the north by a long range of islets and reefs,
      extending in a north-easterly direction a distance of at least 600 yards.
      An excellent roadstead was thus formed by nature, which art early improved
      into a small but commodious harbour, a line of wall being carried out from
      the coast northwards to the most easterly of the islets, and the only
      unprotected side of the harbour being thus securely closed. There is
      reason to believe that this work was completed anterior to the time of
      Alexander,<a href="#linknote-412" name="linknoteref-412"
       id="linknoteref-412">412</a> and was therefore due to the Phoenicians
      themselves, who were not blind to the advantages of closed harbours over
      open roadsteads. They seem also to have strengthened the natural barrier
      towards the north by a continuous wall of huge blocks along the reefs and
      the islets, portions of which are still in existence.

    <p>
      Besides this excellent harbour, 500 yards long by 200 broad, Sidon
      possessed on the southern side of the peninsula a second refuge for its
      ships, less safe, but still more spacious. This was an oval basin, 600
      yards long from north to south, and nearly 400 broad from east to west,
      wholly surrounded by land on three sides, the north, the east, and the
      south, but open for the space of about 200 yards towards the west. In fine
      weather this harbour was probably quite as much used as the other; it was
      protected from all the winds that were commonly prevalent, and offered a
      long stretch of sandy shore free from buildings on which vessels could be
      drawn up.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to mark out the enceinte of the ancient town, or indeed
      to emplace it with any exactitude. Only scanty and scattered remains are
      left here and there between the modern city and the mountains. There is,
      however, towards the south an extensive necropolis,<a href="#linknote-413"
       name="linknoteref-413" id="linknoteref-413">413</a> which marks perhaps
      the southern limits of the city, while towards the east the hills are
      penetrated by a number of sepulchural grottoes, and tombs of various
      kinds, which were also probably outside the walls. Were a northern
      necropolis to be discovered, some idea would be furnished of the extent of
      the city; but at present the plain has been very imperfectly examined in
      this direction. It is from the southern necropolis that the remarkable
      inscription was disinterred which first established beyond all possibility
      of doubt the fact that the modern Saïda is the representative of the
      ancient Sidon.<a href="#linknote-414" name="linknoteref-414"
       id="linknoteref-414">414</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty miles to the south of Sidon was the still more important city&mdash;the
      double city&mdash;of Tzur or Tyre. Tzur signifies &ldquo;a rock,&rdquo; and at this
      point of the Syrian coast (Lat. 33º 17´) there lay at a short distance
      from the shore a set of rocky islets, on the largest of which the original
      city seems to have been built. Indentations are so rare and so shallow
      along this coast, that a maritime people naturally looked out for littoral
      islands, as affording under the circumstances the best protection against
      boisterous winds; and, as in the north Aradus was early seized and
      occupied by Phoenician settlers, so in the south the rock, which became
      the heart of Tyre, was seized, fortified, covered with buildings, and
      converted from a bare stony eminence into a town. At the same time, or not
      much later, a second town grew up on the mainland opposite the isle; and
      the two together were long regarded as constituting a single city. After
      the time of Alexander the continental town went to decay; and the name of
      Palæ-Tyrus was given to it,<a href="#linknote-415" name="linknoteref-415"
       id="linknoteref-415">415</a> to distinguish it from the still flourishing
      city on the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      The islands of which we have spoken formed a chain running nearly in
      parallel to the coast. They were some eleven or twelve in number. The
      southern extremity of the chain was formed by three, the northern by
      seven, small islets.<a href="#linknote-416" name="linknoteref-416"
       id="linknoteref-416">416</a> Intermediate between these lay two islands of
      superior size, which were ultimately converted into one by filling up the
      channel between them. A further enlargement was effected by means of
      substructions thrown out into the sea, probably on two sides, towards the
      east and towards the south. By these means an area was produced sufficient
      for the site of a considerable town. Pliny estimated the circumference of
      the island Tyre at twenty-two stades,<a href="#linknote-417"
       name="linknoteref-417" id="linknoteref-417">417</a> or somewhat more than
      two miles and a half. Modern measurements make the actual present area one
      of above 600,000 square yards.<a href="#linknote-418"
       name="linknoteref-418" id="linknoteref-418">418</a> The shape was an
      irregular trapezium, 1,400 yards along its western face, 800 yards along
      its southern one, 600 along the face towards the east, and rather more
      along the face towards the north-east.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole town was surrounded by a lofty wall, the height of which, on the
      side which faced the mainland, was, we are told, a hundred and fifty feet.<a
      href="#linknote-419" name="linknoteref-419" id="linknoteref-419">419</a>
      Towards the south the foundations of the wall were laid in the sea, and
      may still be traced.<a href="#linknote-420" name="linknoteref-420"
       id="linknoteref-420">420</a> They consist of huge blocks of stone
      strengthened inside by a conglomerate of very hard cement. The wall runs
      out from the south-eastern corner of what was the original island, in a
      direction a little to the south of west, till it reaches the line of the
      western coast, when it turns at a sharp angle, and rejoins the island at
      its south-western extremity. At present sea is found for some distance to
      the north of the wall, and this fact has been thought to show that
      originally it was intended for a pier or quay, and the space within it for
      a harbour;<a href="#linknote-421" name="linknoteref-421"
       id="linknoteref-421">421</a> but the latest explorers are of opinion that
      the space was once filled up with masonry and rubbish, being an artificial
      addition to the island, over which, in the course of time, the sea has
      broken, and reasserted its rights.<a href="#linknote-422"
       name="linknoteref-422" id="linknoteref-422">422</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Sidon, Tyre had two harbours, a northern and a southern. The
      northern, which was called the &ldquo;Sidonian,&rdquo; because it looked towards
      Sidon, was situated on the east of the main island, towards the northern
      end of it. On the west and south the land swept round it in a natural
      curve, effectually guarding two sides; while the remaining two were
      protected by art. On the north a double line of wall was carried out in a
      direction a little south of east for a distance of about three hundred
      yards, the space between the two lines being about a hundred feet. The
      northern line acted as a sort of breakwater, the southern as a pier. This
      last terminated towards the east on reaching a ridge of natural rock, and
      was there met by the eastern wall of the harbour, which ran out in a
      direction nearly due north for a distance of 250 yards, following the
      course of two reefs, which served as its foundation. Between the reefs was
      a space of about 140 feet, which was left open, but could be closed, if
      necessary, by a boom or chain, which was kept in readiness. The dimensions
      of this northern harbour are thought to have been about 370 yards from
      north to south, by about 230 from east to west,<a href="#linknote-423"
       name="linknoteref-423" id="linknoteref-423">423</a> or a little short of
      those which have been assigned to the northern harbour of Sidon.
      Concerning the southern harbour there is considerable difference of
      opinion. Some, as Kenrick and M. Bertou, place it due south of the island,
      and regard its boundary as the line of submarine wall which we have
      already described and regarded as constituting the southern wall of the
      town. Others locate it towards the south-east, and think that it is now
      entirely filled up. A canal connected the two ports, so that vessels could
      pass from the one to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most remarkable of the Tyrian buildings were the royal palace, which
      abutted on the southern wall of the town, and the temples dedicated to
      Baal, Melkarth, Agenor, and Astarte or Ashtoreth.<a href="#linknote-424"
       name="linknoteref-424" id="linknoteref-424">424</a> The probable character
      of the architecture of these buildings will be hereafter considered. With
      respect to their emplacement, it would seem by the most recent
      explorations that the temple of Baal, called by the Greeks that of the
      Olympian Zeus, stood by itself on what was originally a separate islet at
      the south-western corner of the city,<a href="#linknote-425"
       name="linknoteref-425" id="linknoteref-425">425</a> while that of Melkarth
      occupied a position as nearly as possible central,<a href="#linknote-426"
       name="linknoteref-426" id="linknoteref-426">426</a> and that of Agenor was
      placed near the point in which the island terminates toward the north.<a
      href="#linknote-427" name="linknoteref-427" id="linknoteref-427">427</a>
      The houses of the inhabitants were closely crowded together, and rose to
      the height of several storeys.<a href="#linknote-428"
       name="linknoteref-428" id="linknoteref-428">428</a> There was an open
      space for the transaction of business within the walls towards the east,
      called Eurychorus by those Phoenicians who wrote their histories in Greek.<a
      href="#linknote-429" name="linknoteref-429" id="linknoteref-429">429</a>
      The town was full of dyeing establishments, which made it difficult to
      traverse.<a href="#linknote-430" name="linknoteref-430"
       id="linknoteref-430">430</a> The docks and dockyards were towards the
      east.
    </p>
    <p>
      The population of the island Tyre, when it was captured by Alexander,
      seems to have been about forty thousand souls.<a href="#linknote-431"
       name="linknoteref-431" id="linknoteref-431">431</a> As St. Malo, a city
      less than one-third of the size, is known to have had at one time a
      population of twelve thousand,<a href="#linknote-432"
       name="linknoteref-432" id="linknoteref-432">432</a> the number, though
      large for the area, would seem not to be incredible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Palæ-Tyrus, or the continental Tyre, no satisfactory account can be
      given, since it has absolutely left no remains, and the classical notices
      on the subject are exceedingly scanty. At different periods of its
      history, its limits and extent probably varied greatly. Its position was
      nearly opposite the island, and in the early times it must have been, like
      the other coast towns, strongly fortified; but after its capture by
      Alexander the walls do not seem to have been restored, and it became an
      open straggling town, extending along the shore from the river Leontes
      (Litany) to Ras-el-Ain, a distance of seven miles or more. Pliny, who
      wrote when its boundary could still be traced, computed the circuit of
      Palæ-Tyrus and the island Tyre together at nineteen Roman miles,<a
      href="#linknote-433" name="linknoteref-433" id="linknoteref-433">433</a>
      the circuit of the island by itself being less than three miles. Its
      situation, in a plain of great fertility, at the foot of the south-western
      spurs of Lebanon, and near the gorge of the Litany, was one of great
      beauty. Water was supplied to it in great abundance from the copious
      springs of Ras-el-Ain, which were received into a reservoir of an
      octagonal shape, sixty feet in diameter, and inclosed within walls
      eighteen feet in height,<a href="#linknote-434" name="linknoteref-434"
       id="linknoteref-434">434</a> whence they were conveyed northwards to the
      heart of the city by an aqueduct, whereof a part is still remaining.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most important city of Phoenicia towards the north was Arvad, or
      Aradus. Arvad was situated, like Tyre, on a small island off the Syrian
      coast, and lay in Lat. 34º 48´ nearly. It was distant from the shore about
      two miles and a half. The island was even smaller than that which formed
      the nucleus of Tyre, being only about 800 yards, or less than half a mile
      in length, by 500 yards, or rather more than a quarter of a mile in
      breadth.<a href="#linknote-435" name="linknoteref-435" id="linknoteref-435">435</a>
      The axis of the island was from north-west to south-east. It was a bare
      rock, low and flat, without water, and without any natural soil. The iron
      coast was surrounded on three sides, the north, the west, and the south,
      by a number of rocks and small islets, which fringed it like the trimming
      of a shawl. Its Phoenician occupiers early converted this debatable
      territory, half sea half shore, into solid land, by filling up the
      interstices between the rocks with squared stones and a solid cement as
      hard as the rock itself, which remains to this day.<a href="#linknote-436"
       name="linknoteref-436" id="linknoteref-436">436</a> The north-eastern
      portion, which has a length of 150 yards by a breadth of 125, is perfectly
      smooth and almost flat, but with a slight slope towards the east, which is
      thought to show that it was used as a sort of dry dock, on which to draw
      up the lighter vessels, for safety or for repairs.<a href="#linknote-437"
       name="linknoteref-437" id="linknoteref-437">437</a> The western and
      southern increased the area for house-building. Anciently, as at Tyre, the
      houses were built very close together, and had several storeys,<a
      href="#linknote-438" name="linknoteref-438" id="linknoteref-438">438</a>
      for the purpose of accommodating a numerous population. The island was
      wholly without natural harbour; but on the eastern side, which faced the
      mainland, and was turned away from the prevailing winds, the art and
      industry of the inhabitants constructed two ports of a fair size. This was
      effected by carrying out from the shore three piers at right angles into
      the sea, the central one to a distance of from seventy to a hundred yards,
      and the other two very nearly as far&mdash;and thus forming two
      rectangular basins, one on either side of the central pier, which were
      guarded from winds on three sides, and only open towards the east, a
      quarter from which the winds are seldom violent, and on which the
      mainland, less than three miles off, forms a protection. The construction
      of the central pier is remarkable. It is formed of massive blocks of
      sandstone, which are placed transversely, so that their length forms the
      thickness of the pier, and their ends the wall on either side. On both
      sides of the wall are quays of concrete.<a href="#linknote-439"
       name="linknoteref-439" id="linknoteref-439">439</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The line of the ancient enceinte may still be traced around the three
      outer sides of the island. It is a gigantic work, composed of stones from
      fifteen to eighteen feet long, placed transversely, like those of the
      centre pier, and in two places still rising to the height of five or six
      courses (from thirty to forty feet).<a href="#linknote-440"
       name="linknoteref-440" id="linknoteref-440">440</a> The blocks are laid
      side by side without mortar; they are roughly squared, and arranged
      generally in regular courses; but sometimes two courses for a while take
      the place of one.<a href="#linknote-441" name="linknoteref-441"
       id="linknoteref-441">441</a> There is a want of care in the arrangement of
      the blocks, joints in one course being occasionally directly over joints
      in the course below it. The stones are without any bevel or ornamentation
      of any kind. They have been quarried in the island itself, and the beds of
      rock from which they were taken may be seen at no great distance. At one
      point in the western side of the island, the native rock itself has been
      cut into the shape of the wall, and made to take the place of the squared
      stones for the distance of about ten feet.<a href="#linknote-442"
       name="linknoteref-442" id="linknoteref-442">442</a> A moat has also been
      cut along the entire western side, which, with its glacis, served
      apparently to protect the wall from the fury of the waves.<a
      href="#linknote-443" name="linknoteref-443" id="linknoteref-443">443</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      We know nothing of the internal arrangements of the ancient town beyond
      the fact of the closeness and loftiness of the houses. Externally Aradus
      depended on her possessions upon the mainland both for water and for food.
      The barren rock could grow nothing, and was moreover covered with houses.
      Such rainwater as fell on the island was carefully collected and stored in
      tanks and reservoirs,<a href="#linknote-444" name="linknoteref-444"
       id="linknoteref-444">444</a> the remains of which are still to be seen.
      But the ordinary supply of water for daily consumption was derived in time
      of peace from the opposite coast. When this supply was cut off by an enemy
      Aradus had still one further resource. Midway in the channel between the
      island and the continent there burst out at the bottom of the sea a
      fresh-water spring of great strength; by confining this spring within a
      hemisphere of lead to which a leathern pipe was attached the much-needed
      fluid was raised to the surface and received into a vessel moored upon the
      spot, whence supplies were carried to the island.<a href="#linknote-445"
       name="linknoteref-445" id="linknoteref-445">445</a> The phenomenon still
      continues, though the modern inhabitants are too ignorant and unskilful to
      profit by it.<a href="#linknote-446" name="linknoteref-446"
       id="linknoteref-446">446</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      On the mainland Aradus possessed a considerable tract, and had a number of
      cities subject to her. Of these Strabo enumerates six, viz. Paltos,
      Balanea, Carnus&mdash;which he calls the naval station of Aradus&mdash;Enydra,
      Marathus, and Simyra.<a href="#linknote-447" name="linknoteref-447"
       id="linknoteref-447">447</a> Marathus was the most important of these. Its
      name recalls the &ldquo;Brathu&rdquo; of Philo-Byblius<a href="#linknote-448"
       name="linknoteref-448" id="linknoteref-448">448</a> and the &ldquo;Martu&rdquo; of the
      early Babylonian inscriptions,<a href="#linknote-449"
       name="linknoteref-449" id="linknoteref-449">449</a> which was used as a
      general term by some of the primitive monarchs almost in the sense of
      &ldquo;Syria.&rdquo; The word is still preserved in the modern &ldquo;M&rsquo;rith&rdquo; or &ldquo;Amrith,&rdquo; a
      name attached to some extensive ruins in the plain south-east of Aradus,
      which have been carefully examined by M. Renan.<a href="#linknote-450"
       name="linknoteref-450" id="linknoteref-450">450</a> Marathus was an
      ancient Phoenician town, probably one of the most ancient, and was always
      looked upon with some jealousy by the Aradians, who ultimately destroyed
      it and partitioned out the territory among their own citizens.<a
      href="#linknote-451" name="linknoteref-451" id="linknoteref-451">451</a>
      The same fate befell Simyra,<a href="#linknote-452" name="linknoteref-452"
       id="linknoteref-452">452</a> a place of equal antiquity, the home probably
      of those Zemarites who are coupled with the Arvadites in Genesis.<a
      href="#linknote-453" name="linknoteref-453" id="linknoteref-453">453</a>
      Simyra appears as &ldquo;Zimirra&rdquo; in the Assyrian inscriptions, where it is
      connected with Arka,<a href="#linknote-454" name="linknoteref-454"
       id="linknoteref-454">454</a> which was not far distant. Its exact site,
      which was certainly south of Amrith, seems to be fixed by the name Sumrah,
      which attaches to some ruins in the plain about a mile and a half north of
      the Eleutherus (Nahr-el-Kebir) and within a mile of the sea.<a
      href="#linknote-455" name="linknoteref-455" id="linknoteref-455">455</a>
      The other towns&mdash;Paltos, Balanea, Carnus,<a href="#linknote-456"
       name="linknoteref-456" id="linknoteref-456">456</a> and Enydra&mdash;were
      in the more northern portion of the plain, as was also Antaradus, now
      Tortosa, where there are considerable remains, but of a date long
      subsequent to the time of Phoenician ascendancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the remaining Phoenician cities the most important seems to have been
      Gebal, or Byblus. Mentioned under the name of Gubal in the Assyrian
      inscriptions as early as the time of Jehu<a href="#linknote-457"
       name="linknoteref-457" id="linknoteref-457">457</a> (ab. B.C. 840), and
      glanced at even earlier in the Hebrew records, which tell of its
      inhabitants, the Giblites,<a href="#linknote-458" name="linknoteref-458"
       id="linknoteref-458">458</a> Gebal is found as a town of note in the time
      of Alexander the Great,<a href="#linknote-459" name="linknoteref-459"
       id="linknoteref-459">459</a> and again in that of Pompey.<a
      href="#linknote-460" name="linknoteref-460" id="linknoteref-460">460</a>
      The traditions of the Phoenicians themselves made it one of the most
      ancient of the cities; and the historian Philo, who was a native of the
      place, ascribes its foundation to Kronos or Saturn.<a href="#linknote-461"
       name="linknoteref-461" id="linknoteref-461">461</a> It was an especially
      holy city, devoted in the early times to the worship of Beltis,<a
      href="#linknote-462" name="linknoteref-462" id="linknoteref-462">462</a>
      and in the later to that of Adonis.<a href="#linknote-463"
       name="linknoteref-463" id="linknoteref-463">463</a> The position is marked
      beyond all reasonable doubt by the modern Jebeïl, which retains the
      original name very slightly modified, and answers completely to the
      ancient descriptions. The town lies upon the coast, in Lat. 34º 10´
      nearly, about halfway between Tripolis and Berytus, four miles north of
      the point where the Adonis river (now the Ibrahim) empties itself into the
      sea. There is a &ldquo;small but well-sheltered port,"<a href="#linknote-464"
       name="linknoteref-464" id="linknoteref-464">464</a> formed mainly by two
      curved piers which are carried out from the shore towards the north and
      south, and which leave between them only a narrow entrance. The castle
      occupies a commanding position on a hill at a little distance from the
      shore, and has a keep built of bevelled stones of a large size. Several of
      them measure from fifteen to eighteen feet in length, and are from five to
      six feet thick.<a href="#linknote-465" name="linknoteref-465"
       id="linknoteref-465">465</a> They were probably quarried by Giblite
      &ldquo;stone-cutters,&rdquo; but placed in their present position during the middle
      ages.

      Tripolis, situated halfway between Byblus and Aradus, was not one of the
      original Phoenician cities, but was a joint colony from the three
      principal settlements, Tyre, Sidon, and Aradus.<a href="#linknote-466"
       name="linknoteref-466" id="linknoteref-466">466</a> The date of its
      foundation, and its native Phoenician name, are unknown to us: conjecture
      hovers between Hosah, Mahalliba, Uznu, and Siannu, maritime towns of
      Phoenicia known to the Assyrians,<a href="#linknote-467"
       name="linknoteref-467" id="linknoteref-467">467</a> but unmentioned by any
      Greek author. The situation was a promontory, which runs out towards the
      north-west, in Lat. 34º 27´ nearly, for the distance of a mile, and is
      about half a mile wide. The site is &ldquo;well adapted for a haven, as a chain
      of seven small islands, running out to the north-west, affords shelter in
      the direction from which the most violent winds blow."<a
      href="#linknote-468" name="linknoteref-468" id="linknoteref-468">468</a>
      The remotest of these islands is ten miles distant from the shore.<a
      href="#linknote-469" name="linknoteref-469" id="linknoteref-469">469</a>
      We are told that the colonists who founded Tripolis did not intermix, but
      had their separate quarters of the town assigned to them, each surrounded
      by its own wall, and lying at some little distance one from the other.<a
      href="#linknote-470" name="linknoteref-470" id="linknoteref-470">470</a>
      There are no present traces of this arrangement, which seems indicative of
      distrust; but some remains have been found of a wall which was carried
      across the isthmus on the land side.<a href="#linknote-471"
       name="linknoteref-471" id="linknoteref-471">471</a> Tripolis is now
      Tarabolus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aphaca, the only inland Phoenician town of any importance, is now Afka,
      and is visited by most travellers and tourists. It was situated in a
      beautiful spot at the head of the Adonis river,<a href="#linknote-472"
       name="linknoteref-472" id="linknoteref-472">472</a> a sacred stream fabled
      to run with blood once a year, at the festival which commemorated the
      self-mutilation of the Nature-god Adonis. Aphaca was a sort of Delphi, a
      collection of temples rather than a town. It was dedicated especially to
      the worship of the Syrian goddess, Ashtoreth or Venus, sometimes called
      Beltis or Baaltis, whose orgies were of so disgracefully licentious a
      character that they were at last absolutely forbidden by Constantine. At
      present there are no remains on the ancient site except one or two ruins
      of edifices decidedly Roman in character.<a href="#linknote-473"
       name="linknoteref-473" id="linknoteref-473">473</a> Nor is the gorge of
      the Adonis any richer in ancient buildings. There was a time when the
      whole valley formed a sort of &ldquo;Holy Land,"<a href="#linknote-474"
       name="linknoteref-474" id="linknoteref-474">474</a> and at intervals on
      its course were shown &ldquo;Tombs of Adonis,"<a href="#linknote-475"
       name="linknoteref-475" id="linknoteref-475">475</a> analogous to the
      artificial &ldquo;Holy Sepulchres&rdquo; of many European towns in the middle ages.
      All, however, have disappeared, and the traveller looks in vain for any
      traces of that curious cult which in ancient times made Aphaca and its
      river one of the most noted of the holy spots of Syria and a favourite
      resort of pilgrims.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty-three miles south of Byblus was Berytus, which disputed with Byblus
      the palm of antiquity.<a href="#linknote-476" name="linknoteref-476"
       id="linknoteref-476">476</a> Berytus was situated on a promontory in Lat.
      33º 54´, and had a port of a fair size, protected towards the west by a
      pier, which followed the line of a ridge of rocks running out from the
      promontory towards the north. It was not of any importance during the
      flourishing Phoenician period, but grew to greatness under the Romans,<a
      href="#linknote-477" name="linknoteref-477" id="linknoteref-477">477</a>
      when its harbour was much improved, and the town greatly extended.<a
      href="#linknote-478" name="linknoteref-478" id="linknoteref-478">478</a>
      By the time of Justinian it had become the chief city of Phoenicia, and
      was celebrated as a school of law and science.<a href="#linknote-479"
       name="linknoteref-479" id="linknoteref-479">479</a> The natural advantages
      of its situation have caused it to retain a certain importance, and in
      modern times it has drawn to itself almost the whole of the commerce which
      Europe maintains with Syria.

      Arka, or Arqa, the home of the Arkites of Genesis,<a href="#linknote-480"
       name="linknoteref-480" id="linknoteref-480">480</a> can never have been a
      place of much consequence. It lies at a distance of four miles from the
      shore, on one of the outlying hills which form the skirts of Lebanon, in
      Lat. 34º 33, Long. 33º 44´ nearly. The towns nearest to it were Orthosia,
      Simyra, and Tripolis. It was of sufficient consequence to be mentioned in
      the Assyrian Inscriptions,<a href="#linknote-481" name="linknoteref-481"
       id="linknoteref-481">481</a> though not to attract the notice of Strabo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ecdippa, south of Tyre, in Lat. 33º 1´, is no doubt the scriptural Achzib,<a
      href="#linknote-482" name="linknoteref-482" id="linknoteref-482">482</a>
      which was made the northern boundary of Asher at the division of the Holy
      Land among the twelve tribes. The Assyrian monarchs speak of it under the
      same name, but mention it rarely, and apparently as a dependency of Sidon.<a
      href="#linknote-483" name="linknoteref-483" id="linknoteref-483">483</a>
      The old name, in the shortened form of &ldquo;Zeb,&rdquo; still clings to the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still further to the south, five miles from Ecdippa, and about twenty-two
      miles from Tyre, lay Akko or Accho, at the northern extremity of a wide
      bay, which terminates towards the south in the promontory of Carmel. Next
      to the Bay of St. George, near Beyrout, this is the best natural roadstead
      on the Syrian coast; and this advantage, combined with its vicinity to the
      plain of Esdraelon, has given to Accho at various periods of history a
      high importance, as in some sense &ldquo;the key of Syria.&rdquo; The Assyrians, in
      their wars with Palestine and Egypt, took care to conquer and retain it.<a
      href="#linknote-484" name="linknoteref-484" id="linknoteref-484">484</a>
      When the Ptolemies became masters of the tract between Egypt and Mount
      Taurus, they at once saw its value, occupied it, strengthened its
      defences, and gave it the name of Ptolemaïs. The old appellation has,
      however, reasserted itself; and, as Acre, the city played an important
      part in the Crusades, in the Napoleonic attempt on Egypt, and in the
      comparatively recent expedition of Ibrahim Pasha. It had a small port of
      its own to the south-east of the promontory on which it stood, which, like
      the other ports of the ancient Phoenicia, is at the present time almost
      wholly sanded up.<a href="#linknote-485" name="linknoteref-485"
       id="linknoteref-485">485</a> But its roadstead was of more importance than
      its port, and was used by the Persians as a station for their fleet, from
      which they could keep watch on Egypt.<a href="#linknote-486"
       name="linknoteref-486" id="linknoteref-486">486</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      South of Accho and south of Carmel, close upon the shore, which is here
      low and flat, was Dor, now Tantura, the seat of a kingdom in the time of
      Joshua,<a href="#linknote-487" name="linknoteref-487" id="linknoteref-487">487</a>
      and allotted after its conquest to Manasseh.<a href="#linknote-488"
       name="linknoteref-488" id="linknoteref-488">488</a> Here Solomon placed
      one of his purveyors,<a href="#linknote-489" name="linknoteref-489"
       id="linknoteref-489">489</a> and here the great Assyrian monarch
      Tiglath-pileser II. likewise placed a &ldquo;governor,&rdquo; about B.C. 732, when he
      reduced it.<a href="#linknote-490" name="linknoteref-490"
       id="linknoteref-490">490</a> Dor was one of the places where the
      shell-fish which produced the purple dye were most abundant, and remained
      in the hands of the Phoenicians during all the political changes which
      swept over Syria and Palestine to a late period.<a href="#linknote-491"
       name="linknoteref-491" id="linknoteref-491">491</a> It had fallen to ruin,
      however, by the time of Jerome,<a href="#linknote-492"
       name="linknoteref-492" id="linknoteref-492">492</a> and the present
      remains are unimportant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extreme Phoenician city on the south was Japho or Joppa. It lay in
      Lat. 32º 2´, close to the territory of Dan,<a href="#linknote-493"
       name="linknoteref-493" id="linknoteref-493">493</a> but continued to be
      held by the Phoenicians until the time of the Maccabees,<a
      href="#linknote-494" name="linknoteref-494" id="linknoteref-494">494</a>
      when it became Jewish. The town was situated on the slope of a low hill
      near the sea, and possessed anciently a tolerable harbour, from which a
      trade was carried on with Tartessus.<a href="#linknote-495"
       name="linknoteref-495" id="linknoteref-495">495</a> As the seaport nearest
      to Jerusalem, it was naturally the chief medium of the commerce which was
      carried on between the Phoenicians and the Jews. Thither, in the time of
      Solomon, were brought the floats of timber cut in Lebanon for the
      construction of the Temple and the royal palace; and thither, no doubt,
      were conveyed &ldquo;the wheat, and the barley, and the oil, and the wine,&rdquo;
       which the Phoenicians received in return for their firs and cedars.<a
      href="#linknote-496" name="linknoteref-496" id="linknoteref-496">496</a> A
      similar exchange of commodities was made nearly five centuries later at
      the same place, when the Jews returned from the captivity under
      Zerubbabel.<a href="#linknote-497" name="linknoteref-497"
       id="linknoteref-497">497</a> In Roman times the foundation of Cæsaræa
      reduced Joppa to insignificance; yet it still, as Jaffa or Yáfa, retains a
      certain amount of trade, and is famous for its palm-groves and gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joppa towards the south was balanced by Ramantha, or Laodicea, towards the
      north. Fifty miles north of Aradus and Antaradus (Tortosa), in Lat. 35º
      30´ nearly, occupying the slope of a hill facing the sea, with chalky
      cliffs on either side, that, like those of Dover, whiten the sea, and with
      Mount Casius in the background, lay the most northern of all the
      Phoenician cities in a fertile and beautiful territory.<a
      href="#linknote-498" name="linknoteref-498" id="linknoteref-498">498</a>
      The original appellation was, we are told, Ramantha,<a href="#linknote-499"
       name="linknoteref-499" id="linknoteref-499">499</a> a name intended
      probably to mark the <i>lofty</i> situation of the place;<a
      href="#linknote-4100" name="linknoteref-4100" id="linknoteref-4100">4100</a>
      but this appellation was forced to give way to the Greek term, Laodicea,
      when Seleucus Nicator, having become king of Syria, partially rebuilt
      Ramantha and colonised it with Greeks.<a href="#linknote-4101"       name="linknoteref-4101" id="linknoteref-4101">4101</a> The coins of the
      city under the Seleucidæ show its semi-Greek, semi-Phoenician character,
      having legends in both languages. One of these, in the Phoenician
      character, is read as <i>l&rsquo;Ladika am b&rsquo;Canaan</i>, i.e. &ldquo;of Laodicea, a
      metropolis in Canaan,&rdquo; and seems to show that the city claimed not only to
      be independent, but to have founded, and to hold under its sway, a number
      of smaller towns.<a href="#linknote-4102" name="linknoteref-4102"       id="linknoteref-4102">4102</a> It may have exercised a dominion over the
      entire tract from Mount Casius to Paltos, where the dominion of Aradus
      began. Laodicea is now Latakia, and is famous for the tobacco grown in the
      neighbourhood. It still makes use of its ancient port, which would be
      fairly commodious if it were cleared of the sand that at present chokes
      it.<a href="#linknote-4103" name="linknoteref-4103" id="linknoteref-4103">4103</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been said that Phoenicia was composed of &ldquo;three worlds&rdquo; with
      distinct characteristics;<a href="#linknote-4104" name="linknoteref-4104"       id="linknoteref-4104">4104</a> but perhaps the number of the &ldquo;worlds&rdquo;
       should be extended to five. First came that of Ramantha, reaching from the
      Mons Casius to the river Badas, a distance of about fifty miles, a remote
      and utterly sequestered region, into which neither Assyria nor Egypt ever
      thought of penetrating. Commerce with Cyprus and southern Asia Minor was
      especially open to the mariners of this region, who could see the shores
      of Cyprus without difficulty on a clear day. Next came the &ldquo;world&rdquo; of
      Aradus, reaching along the coast from the Badas to the Eleutherus, another
      stretch of fifty miles, and including the littoral islands, especially
      that of Ruad, on which Aradus was built. This tract was less sequestered
      than the more northern one, and contains traces of having been subjected
      to influences from Egypt at an early period. The gap between Lebanon and
      Bargylus made the Aradian territory accessible from the Coelesyrian
      valley; and there is reason to believe that one of the roads which
      Egyptian and Assyrian conquest followed in these parts was that which
      passed along the coast as far as the Eleutherus and then turned eastward
      and north-eastward to Emesa (Hems) and Hamath. It must have been
      conquerors marching by this line who set up their effigies at the mouth of
      the Nahr-el-Kelb, and those who pursued it would naturally make a point of
      reducing Aradus. Thus this second Phoenician &ldquo;world&rdquo; has not the isolated
      character of the first, but shows marks of Assyrian, and still more of
      early Egyptian, influence. The third Phoenician &ldquo;world&rdquo; is that of Gebal
      or Byblus. Its limits would seem to be the Eleutherus on the north, and on
      the south the Tamyras, which would allow it a length of a little above
      eighty miles. This district, it has been said, preserved to the last days
      of paganism a character which was original and well marked. Within its
      limits the religious sentiment had more intensity and played a more
      important part in life than elsewhere in Phoenicia. Byblus was a sort of
      Phoenician Jerusalem. By their turn of mind and by the language which they
      spoke, the Byblians or Giblites seem to have been, of all the Phoenicians,
      those who most resembled the Hebrews. King Jehavmelek, who probably
      reigned at Byblus about B.C. 400, calls himself &ldquo;a just king,&rdquo; and prays
      that he may obtain favour in the sight of God. Later on it was at Byblus,
      and in the valleys of the Lebanon depending on it, that the inhabitants
      celebrated those mysteries of Astarte, together with that orgiastic
      worship of Adonis or Tammuz, which were so popular in Syria during the
      whole of the Greco-Roman period.<a href="#linknote-4105"       name="linknoteref-4105" id="linknoteref-4105">4105</a> The fourth
      Phoenician &ldquo;world&rdquo; was that of Tyre and Sidon, beginning at the Tamyras
      and ending with the promontory of Carmel. Here it was that the Phoenician
      character developed especially those traits by which it is commonly known
      to the world at large&mdash;a genius for commerce and industry, a passion
      for the undertaking of long and perilous voyages, an adaptability to
      circumstances of all kinds, and an address in dealing with wild tribes of
      many different kinds which has rarely been equalled and never exceeded.
      &ldquo;All that we are about to say of Phoenicia,&rdquo; declares the author recently
      quoted, &ldquo;of its rapid expansion and the influence which it exercised over
      the nations of the West, must be understood especially of Tyre and Sidon.
      The other towns might furnish sailors to man the Tyrian fleet or
      merchandise for their cargo, but it was Sidon first and then (with even
      more determination and endurance) Tyre which took the initiative and the
      conduct of the movement; it was the mariners of these two towns who, with
      eyes fixed on the setting sun, pushed their explorations as far as the
      Pillars of Hercules, and eventually even further."<a href="#linknote-4106"       name="linknoteref-4106" id="linknoteref-4106">4106</a> The last and least
      important of the Phoenician &ldquo;worlds&rdquo; was the southern one, extending sixty
      miles from Carmel to Joppa&mdash;a tract from which the Phoenician
      character was well nigh trampled out by the feet of strangers ever passing
      up and down the smooth and featureless region, along which lay the
      recognised line of route between Syria and Mesopotamia on the one hand,
      Philistia and Egypt on the other.<a href="#linknote-4107"       name="linknoteref-4107" id="linknoteref-4107">4107</a>

    <p>
      The narrowness of the territory which the Phoenicians occupied the
      military strength of their neighbours towards the north and towards the
      south, and their own preference of maritime over agricultural pursuits,
      combined to force them, as they began to increase and multiply, to find a
      vent for their superfluous population in colonies. The military strength
      of Philistia and Egypt barred them out from expansion upon the south; the
      wild savagery of the mountain races in Casius, northern Bargylus, and
      Amanus was an effectual barrier towards the north; but before them lay the
      open Mediterranean, placid during the greater portion of the year, and
      conducting to a hundred lands, thinly peopled, or even unoccupied, where
      there was ample room for any number of immigrants. The trade of the
      Phoenicians with the countries bordering the Eastern Mediterranean must be
      regarded as established long previously to the time when they began to
      feel cramped for space; and thus, when that time arrived, they had no
      difficulty in finding fresh localities to occupy, except such as might
      arise from a too abundant amplitude of choice. Right in front of them lay,
      at the distance of not more than seventy miles, visible from Casius in
      clear weather,<a href="#linknote-51" name="linknoteref-51"
       id="linknoteref-51">51</a> the large and important island, once known as
      Chittim,<a href="#linknote-52" name="linknoteref-52" id="linknoteref-52">52</a>
      and afterwards as Cyprus, which played so important a part in the history
      of the East from the time of Sargon and Sennacherib to that of Bragadino
      and Mustapha Pasha. To the right, well visible from Cyprus, was the
      fertile tract of Cilicia Campestris, which led on to the rich and
      picturesque regions of Pamphylia, Lycia, and Caria. From Caria stretched
      out, like a string of stepping-stones between Asia and Europe, the hundred
      islets of the Ægean, Cyclades, and Sporades, and others, inviting
      settlers, and conducting to the large islands of Crete and Euboea, and the
      shores of Attica and the Peloponnese. It is impossible to trace with any
      exactness the order in which the Phoenician colonies were founded. A
      thousand incidental circumstances&mdash;a thousand caprices&mdash;may have
      deranged what may be called the natural or geographical order, and have
      caused the historical order to diverge from it; but, on the whole,
      probably something like the geographical order was observed; and, at any
      rate, it will be most convenient, in default of sufficient data for an
      historical arrangement, to adopt in the present place a geographic one,
      and, beginning with those nearest to Phoenicia itself in the Eastern
      Mediterranean, to proceed westward to the Straits of Gibraltar, reserving
      for the last those outside the Straits on the shores of the Atlantic
      Ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nearest, and probably the first, region to attract Phoenician colonies
      was the island of Cyprus. Cyprus lies in the corner of the Eastern
      Mediterranean formed by the projection of Asia Minor from the Syrian
      shore. Its mountain chains run parallel with Taurus, and it is to Asia
      Minor that it presents its longer flank, while to Phoenicia it presents
      merely one of its extremities. Its length from east to west is 145 miles,
      its greatest width about sixty miles.<a href="#linknote-53"
       name="linknoteref-53" id="linknoteref-53">53</a> Two strongly marked
      mountain ranges form its most salient features, the one running close
      along the north coast from Cape Kormaciti to Cape S. Andreas; the other
      nearly central, but nearer the south, beginning at Cape Renaouti in the
      west and terminating at Cape Greco. The mountain ranges are connected by a
      tract of high ground towards the centre, and separated by two broad
      plains,<a href="#linknote-54" name="linknoteref-54" id="linknoteref-54">54</a>
      towards the east and west. The eastern plain is the more important of the
      two. It extends along the course of the Pediæus from Leucosia, or Nicosia,
      the present capital, to Salamis, a distance of thirty-five miles, and is
      from five to twelve miles wide. The fertility of the soil was reckoned in
      ancient times to equal that of Egypt.<a href="#linknote-55"
       name="linknoteref-55" id="linknoteref-55">55</a> The western plain, that
      of Morfou, is much smaller, and is watered by a less important river. The
      whole island, when it first became known to the Phoenicians, was well
      wooded.<a href="#linknote-56" name="linknoteref-56" id="linknoteref-56">56</a>
      Lovely glens opened upon them, as they sailed along its southern coast,
      watered by clear streams from the southern mountain-range, and shaded by
      thick woods of pine and cedar, the latter of which are said to have in
      some cases attained a greater size even than those of the Lebanon.<a
      href="#linknote-57" name="linknoteref-57" id="linknoteref-57">57</a> The
      range was also prolific of valuable metals.<a href="#linknote-58"
       name="linknoteref-58" id="linknoteref-58">58</a> Gold and silver were
      found in places, but only in small quantities; iron was yielded in
      considerable abundance; but the chief supply was that of copper, which
      derived its name from that of the island.<a href="#linknote-59"
       name="linknoteref-59" id="linknoteref-59">59</a> Other products of the
      island were wheat of excellent quality; the rich Cyprian wine which
      retains its strength and flavour for well nigh a century, the <i>henna</i>
      dye obtained from the plant called <i>copher</i> or <i>cyprus</i>, the <i>Lawsonia
      alba</i> of modern botany; valuable pigments of various kinds, red,
      yellow, green, and amber; hemp and flax; tar, boxwood,<a
      href="#linknote-510" name="linknoteref-510" id="linknoteref-510">510</a>
      and all the materials requisite for shipbuilding from the heavy timbers
      needed for the keel to the lightest spar and the flimsiest sail.<a
      href="#linknote-511" name="linknoteref-511" id="linknoteref-511">511</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The earliest of the Phoenician settlements in Cyprus seem to have lain
      upon its southern coast. Here were Citium, Amathus, Curium, and Paphus,
      the Palæ-paphus of the geographers, which have all yielded abundant traces
      of a Phoenician occupation at a very distant period. Citium, now Larnaka,
      was on the western side of a deep bay, which indents the more eastern
      portion of the southern coast, between the promontories of Citi and Pyla.
      It is sheltered from all winds except the south-east, and continues to the
      present day the chief port of the island. The Phoenician settlers improved
      on the natural position by the formation of an artificial basin, enclosed
      within piers, the lines of which may be traced, though the basin itself is
      sanded up.<a href="#linknote-512" name="linknoteref-512"
       id="linknoteref-512">512</a> A plain extends for some distance inland, on
      which the palm-tree flourishes, and which is capable of producing
      excellent crops of wheat.<a href="#linknote-513" name="linknoteref-513"
       id="linknoteref-513">513</a> Access to the interior is easy; for the
      mountain range sinks as it proceeds eastward, and between Citium and Dali
      (Idalium), on a tributary of the Pediæus, is of small elevation. There are
      indications that the Phoenicians did not confine themselves to the coast,
      but penetrated into the interior, and even settled there in large numbers.
      Idalium, sixteen miles north-west of Citium, and Golgi (Athiénau), ten
      miles nearly due north of the same, show traces of having supported for a
      considerable time a large Phoenician population,<a href="#linknote-514"
       name="linknoteref-514" id="linknoteref-514">514</a> and must be regarded
      as outposts advanced from Citium into the mountains for trading, and
      perhaps for mining purposes. Idalium (Dali) has a most extensive
      Phoenician necropolis; the interments have a most archaic character; and
      their Phoenician origin is indicated both by their close resemblance to
      interments in Phoenicia proper and by the discovery, in connection with
      them, of Phoenician inscriptions.<a href="#linknote-515"
       name="linknoteref-515" id="linknoteref-515">515</a> At Golgi the remains
      scarcely claim so remote an antiquity. They belong to the time when
      Phoenician art was dominated by a strong Egyptian influence, and when it
      also begins to have a partially Hellenic character. Some critics assign
      them to the sixth, or even to the fifth century, B.C.<a
      href="#linknote-516" name="linknoteref-516" id="linknoteref-516">516</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      West of Citium, also upon the south coast, and in a favourable situation
      for trade with the interior, was Amathus. The name Amathus has been
      connected with &ldquo;Hamath;"<a href="#linknote-517" name="linknoteref-517"
       id="linknoteref-517">517</a> but there is no reason to suppose that the
      Hamathites were Phoenicians. Amathus, which Stephen of Byzantium calls &ldquo;a
      most ancient Cyprian city,"<a href="#linknote-518" name="linknoteref-518"
       id="linknoteref-518">518</a> was probably among the earliest of the
      Phoenician settlements in the island. It lay in the bay formed by the
      projection of Cape Gatto from the coast, and, like Citium, looked to the
      south-east. Westward and south-westward stretched an extensive plain,
      fertile and well-watered, shaded by carob and olive-trees,<a
      href="#linknote-519" name="linknoteref-519" id="linknoteref-519">519</a>
      whilst towards the north were the rich copper mines from which the
      Amathusians derived much of their prosperity. The site has yielded a
      considerable amount of Phoenician remains&mdash;tombs, sarcophagi, vases,
      bowls, pateræ and statuettes.<a href="#linknote-520" name="linknoteref-520"
       id="linknoteref-520">520</a> Many of the tombs resemble those at Idalium;
      others are stone chambers deeply buried in the earth. The mimetic art
      shows Assyrian and Egyptian influence, but is essentially Phoenician, and
      of great interest. Further reference will be made to it in the Chapter on
      the Æsthetic Art of the Phoenicians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still further to the west, in the centre of the bay enclosed between the
      promontories of Zeugari and Boosoura, was the colony of Curium, on a
      branch of the river Kuras. Curium lay wholly open to the
      south-western-gales, but had a long stretch of sandy shore towards the
      south-east, on which vessels could be drawn up. The town was situated on a
      rocky elevation, 300 feet in height, and was further defended by a strong
      wall, a large portion of which may still be traced.<a href="#linknote-521"
       name="linknoteref-521" id="linknoteref-521">521</a> The richest discovery
      of Phoenician ornaments and objects of art that has yet been made took
      place at Curium, where, in the year 1874, General Di Cesnola happened upon
      a set of &ldquo;Treasure Chambers&rdquo; containing several hundreds of rings, gems,
      necklaces, bracelets, armlets, ear-rings, bowls, basins, jugs, pateræ,
      &amp;c., in the precious metals, which have formed the principal material
      for all recent disquisitions on the true character and excellency of
      Phoenician art. Commencing with works of which the probable date is the
      fifteenth or sixteenth century B.C., and descending at least as far as the
      best Greek period<a href="#linknote-522" name="linknoteref-522"
       id="linknoteref-522">522</a> (B.C. 500-400), embracing, moreover, works
      which are purely Assyrian, purely Egyptian, and purely Greek, this
      collection has yet so predominant a Phoenician character as to mark
      Curium, notwithstanding the contrary assertions of the Greeks themselves,<a
      href="#linknote-523" name="linknoteref-523" id="linknoteref-523">523</a>
      for a thoroughly Phoenician town. And the history of the place confirms
      this view, since Curium sided with Amathus and the Persians in the war of
      Onesilus.<a href="#linknote-524" name="linknoteref-524"
       id="linknoteref-524">524</a> No doubt, like most of the other Phoenician
      cities in Cyprus, it was Hellenised gradually; but there must have been
      many centuries during which it was an emporium of Phoenician trade and a
      centre of Phoenician influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where the southern coast of Cyprus begins to trend to the north-west, and
      a river of some size, the Bocarus or Diorizus, reaches the sea, stood the
      Phoenician settlement of Paphos, founded (as was said<a
      href="#linknote-525" name="linknoteref-525" id="linknoteref-525">525</a>)
      by Cinyras, king of Byblus. Here was one of the most celebrated of all the
      temples of Astarté or Ashtoreth,<a href="#linknote-526"
       name="linknoteref-526" id="linknoteref-526">526</a> the Phoenician
      Nature-Goddess; and here ruled for many centuries the sacerdotal class of
      the Cinyridæ. The remains of the temple have been identified, and will be
      described in a future chapter. They have the massive character of all
      early Phoenician architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among other Phoenician settlements in Cyprus were, it is probable,
      Salamis, Ammochosta (now Famagosta), Tamasus, and Soli. Salamis must be
      regarded as originally Phoenician on account of the name, which cannot be
      viewed as anything but another form of the Hebrew &ldquo;Salem,&rdquo; the alternative
      name of Jerusalem.<a href="#linknote-527" name="linknoteref-527"
       id="linknoteref-527">527</a> Salamis lay on the eastern coast of the
      island at the mouth of the main river, the Pediæus. It occupied the centre
      of a large bay which looked towards Phoenicia, and would naturally be the
      place where the Phoenicians would first land. There is no natural harbour
      beyond that afforded by the mouth of the Pediæus, but a harbour was easily
      made by throwing out piers into the bay; and of this, which is now sanded
      up, the outline may be traced.<a href="#linknote-528"
       name="linknoteref-528" id="linknoteref-528">528</a> There are, however, no
      remains, either at Salamis or in the immediate neighbourhood, which can
      claim to be regarded as Phoenician; and the glories of the city belong to
      the history of Greece.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ammochosta was situated within a few miles of Salamis, towards the south.<a
      href="#linknote-529" name="linknoteref-529" id="linknoteref-529">529</a>
      Its first appearance in history belongs to the reign of Esarhaddon (B.C.
      680), when we find it in a list of ten Cyprian cities, each having its own
      king, who acknowledged for their suzerain the great monarch of Assyria.<a
      href="#linknote-530" name="linknoteref-530" id="linknoteref-530">530</a>
      Soon afterwards it again occurs among the cities tributary to
      Asshur-bani-pal.<a href="#linknote-531" name="linknoteref-531"
       id="linknoteref-531">531</a> Otherwise we have no mention of it in
      Phoenician times. As Famagosta it was famous in the wars between the
      Venetians and the Turks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tamasus, or Tamassus, was an inland city, and the chief seat of the mining
      operations which the Phoenicians carried on in the island in search of
      copper.<a href="#linknote-532" name="linknoteref-532" id="linknoteref-532">532</a>
      It lay a few miles to the west of Idalium (Dali), on the northern flank of
      the southern mountain chain. The river Pediæus flowed at its feet. Like
      Ammochosta, it appears among the Cyprian towns which in the seventh
      century B.C. were tributary to the Assyrians.<a href="#linknote-533"
       name="linknoteref-533" id="linknoteref-533">533</a> The site is still
      insufficiently explored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soli lay upon the coast, in the recess of the gulf of Morfou.<a
      href="#linknote-534" name="linknoteref-534" id="linknoteref-534">534</a>
      The fiction of its foundation by Philocyprus at the suggestion of Solon<a
      href="#linknote-535" name="linknoteref-535" id="linknoteref-535">535</a>
      is entirely disproved by the occurrence of the name in the Assyrian lists
      of Cyprian towns a century before Solon&rsquo;s time. Its sympathies were with
      the Phoenician, and not with the Hellenic, population of the island, as
      was markedly shown when it joined with Amathus and Citium in calling to
      Artaxerxes for help against Evagoras.<a href="#linknote-536"
       name="linknoteref-536" id="linknoteref-536">536</a> The city stood on the
      left bank of the river Clarius, and covered the northern slope of a low
      hill detached from the main range, extending also over the low ground at
      the foot of the hill to within a short distance of the shore, where are to
      be seen the remains of the ancient harbour. The soil in the neighbourhood
      is very rich, and adapted for almost any kind of cultivation.<a
      href="#linknote-537" name="linknoteref-537" id="linknoteref-537">537</a>
      In the mountains towards the south were prolific veins of copper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The northern coast of the island between Capes Cormaciti and S. Andreas
      does not seem to have attracted the Phoenicians, though there are some who
      regard Lapethus and Cerynia as Phoenician settlements.<a
      href="#linknote-538" name="linknoteref-538" id="linknoteref-538">538</a>
      It is a rock-bound shore of no very tempting aspect, behind which the
      mountain range rises up steeply. Such Phoenician emigrants as held their
      way along the Salaminian plain and, rounding Cape S. Andreas, passed into
      the channel that separates Cyprus from the mainland, found the coast upon
      their right attract them far more than that upon their left, and formed
      settlements in Cilicia which ultimately became of considerable importance.
      The chief of these was Tars or Tarsus, probably the Tarshish of Genesis,<a
      href="#linknote-539" name="linknoteref-539" id="linknoteref-539">539</a>
      though not that of the later Books, a Phoenician city, which has
      Phoenician characters upon its coins, and worshipped the supreme
      Phoenician deity under the title of &ldquo;Baal Tars,&rdquo; &ldquo;the Lord of Tarsus."<a
      href="#linknote-540" name="linknoteref-540" id="linknoteref-540">540</a>
      Tarsus commanded the rich Cilician plain up to the very roots of Taurus,
      was watered by the copious stream of the Cydnus, and had at its mouth a
      commodious harbour. Excellent timber for shipbuilding grew on the slopes
      of the hills bounding the plain, and the river afforded a ready means of
      floating such timber down to the sea. Cleopatra&rsquo;s ships are said to have
      been derived from the Cilician forests, which Antony made over to her for
      the purpose.<a href="#linknote-541" name="linknoteref-541"
       id="linknoteref-541">541</a> Other Phoenician settlements upon the
      Cilician coast were, it is probable, Soli, Celenderis, and Nagidus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pursuing their way westward, in search of new abodes, the emigrants would
      pass along the coast, first of Pamphylia and then of Lycia. In Pamphylia
      there is no settlement that can be with confidence assigned to them; but
      in Lycia it would seem that they colonised Phaselis, and perhaps other
      places. The mountain which rises immediately behind Phaselis was called
      &ldquo;Solyma;"<a href="#linknote-542" name="linknoteref-542"
       id="linknoteref-542">542</a> and a very little to the south was another
      mountain known as &ldquo;Phoenicus."<a href="#linknote-543"
       name="linknoteref-543" id="linknoteref-543">543</a> Somewhat further to
      the west lies the cape still called Cape Phineka,<a href="#linknote-544"
       name="linknoteref-544" id="linknoteref-544">544</a> in which the root
      Phoenix ({phoinix}) is again to be detected. A large district inland was
      named Cabalis or Cabalia,<a href="#linknote-545" name="linknoteref-545"
       id="linknoteref-545">545</a> or (compare Phoen. and Heb. <i>gebal</i>,
      mod. Arab. <i>jebel</i>) the &ldquo;mountain&rdquo; country. Phaselis was situated on
      a promontory projecting south-eastward into the Mediterranean,<a
      href="#linknote-546" name="linknoteref-546" id="linknoteref-546">546</a>
      and was reckoned to have three harbours,<a href="#linknote-547"
       name="linknoteref-547" id="linknoteref-547">547</a> which are marked in
      the accompanying chart. Of these the principal one was that on the western
      side of the isthmus, which was formed by a stone pier carried out for more
      than two hundred yards into the sea, and still to be traced under the
      water.<a href="#linknote-548" name="linknoteref-548" id="linknoteref-548">548</a>
      The other two, which were of smaller size, lay towards the east. The
      Phoenicians were probably tempted to make a settlement at the place,
      partly by the three ports, partly by the abundance of excellent timber for
      shipbuilding which the neighbourhood furnishes. &ldquo;Between Phaselis and Cape
      Avora, a little north of it,&rdquo; says a modern traveller, &ldquo;a belt of large
      and handsome pines borders the shore for some miles."<a
      href="#linknote-549" name="linknoteref-549" id="linknoteref-549">549</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      From Lycia the Asiatic coast westward and north-westward was known as
      Caria; and here Phoenician settlements appear to have been numerous. The
      entire country was at any rate called Phoenicé by some authors.<a
      href="#linknote-550" name="linknoteref-550" id="linknoteref-550">550</a>
      But the circumstances do not admit of our pointing out any special
      Phoenician settlements in this quarter, which early fell under almost
      exclusive Greek influence. There are ample grounds, however, for believing
      that the Phoenicians colonised Rhodes at the south-western angle of Asia
      Minor, off the Carian coast. According to Conon,<a href="#linknote-551"
       name="linknoteref-551" id="linknoteref-551">551</a> the earliest
      inhabitants of Rhodes were the Heliades, whom the Phoenicians expelled.
      The Phoenicians themselves were at a later date expelled by the Carians,
      and the Carians by the Greeks. Ergeias, however, the native historian,
      declared<a href="#linknote-552" name="linknoteref-552" id="linknoteref-552">552</a>
      that the Phoenicians remained, at any rate in some parts of the island,
      until the Greeks drove them out. Ialysus was, he said, one of their
      cities. Dictys Cretensis placed Phoenicians, not only in Ialysus, but in
      Camirus also.<a href="#linknote-553" name="linknoteref-553"
       id="linknoteref-553">553</a> It is the conclusion of Kenrick that &ldquo;the
      Phoenician settlement in Rhodes was the first which introduced
      civilisation among the primeval inhabitants, and that they maintained
      their ascendancy till the rise of the naval power of the Carians. These
      new settlers reduced the Phoenicians to the occupancy of three principal
      towns&rdquo;&mdash;i.e. Lindus, Ialysus, and Camirus; but &ldquo;from these too they
      were expelled by the Dorians, or only allowed to remain at Ialysus as the
      hereditary priesthood of their native god."<a href="#linknote-554"
       name="linknoteref-554" id="linknoteref-554">554</a> Rhodes is an island
      about one-fourth the size of Cyprus, with its axis from the north-east to
      the south-west. It possesses excellent harbours, accessible from all
      quarters,<a href="#linknote-555" name="linknoteref-555"
       id="linknoteref-555">555</a> and furnishing a secure shelter in all
      weathers. The fertility of the soil is great; and the remarkable history
      of the island shows the importance which attaches to it in the hands of an
      enterprising people. Turkish apathy has, however, succeeded in reducing it
      to insignificance.

      The acquisition of Rhodes led the stream of Phoenician colonisation
      onwards in two directions, south-westward and north-westward.
      South-westward, it passed by way of Carpathus and Casus to Crete, and then
      to Cythera; north-westward, by way of Chalcia, Telos, and Astypalæa, to
      the Cyclades and Sporades. The presence of the Phoenicians in Crete is
      indicated by the haven &ldquo;Phoenix,&rdquo; where St. Paul&rsquo;s conductors hoped to
      have wintered their ship;<a href="#linknote-556" name="linknoteref-556"
       id="linknoteref-556">556</a> by the town of Itanus, which was named after
      a Phoenician founder,<a href="#linknote-557" name="linknoteref-557"
       id="linknoteref-557">557</a> and was a staple of the purple-trade,<a
      href="#linknote-558" name="linknoteref-558" id="linknoteref-558">558</a>
      and by the existence near port Phoenix of a town called &ldquo;Araden.&rdquo; Leben,
      on the south coast, near Cape Leo, seems also to have derived its name
      from the Semitic word for &ldquo;lion."<a href="#linknote-559"
       name="linknoteref-559" id="linknoteref-559">559</a> Crete, however, does
      not appear to have been occupied by the Phoenicians at more than a few
      points, or for colonising so much as for trading purposes. They used its
      southern ports for refitting and repairing their ships, but did not
      penetrate into the interior, must less attempt to take possession of the
      whole extensive territory. It was otherwise with the smaller islands.
      Cythera is said to have derived its name from the Phoenician who colonised
      it, and the same is also reported of Melos.<a href="#linknote-560"
       name="linknoteref-560" id="linknoteref-560">560</a> Ios was, we are told,
      originally called Phoenicé;<a href="#linknote-561" name="linknoteref-561"

      to Thucydides,<a href="#linknote-565" name="linknoteref-565"
       id="linknoteref-565">565</a> colonised in remote times &ldquo;the greater part
      of the islands of the Ænean.&rdquo; There was a time when probably all the Ægean
      islands were Phoenician possessions, or at any rate acknowledged
      Phoenician influence, and Siphnus gave its gold, its silver,<a
      href="#linknote-566" name="linknoteref-566" id="linknoteref-566">566</a>
      and its lead,<a href="#linknote-567" name="linknoteref-567"

      href="#linknote-571" name="linknoteref-571" id="linknoteref-571">571</a>
      to increase the wealth and advance the commercial interests of their
      Phoenician masters.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the Sporades and Cyclades the advance was easy to the islands of the
      Northern Ægean, Lemnos, Imbrus, Thasos, and Samothrace. The settlement of
      the Phoenicians in Thasos is attested by Herodotus, who says that the
      Tyrian Hercules (Melkarth) was worshipped there,<a href="#linknote-572"
       name="linknoteref-572" id="linknoteref-572">572</a> and ascribes to the
      Phoenicians extensive mining operations on the eastern shores of the
      island between Ænyra and Coenyra.<a href="#linknote-573"
       name="linknoteref-573" id="linknoteref-573">573</a> A Phoenician
      occupation of Lemnos, Imbrus, and Samothrace is indicated by the worship
      in those islands of the Cabeiri,<a href="#linknote-574"
       name="linknoteref-574" id="linknoteref-574">574</a> who were undoubtedly
      Phoenician deities. Whether the Phoenicians passed from these islands to
      the Thracian mainland, and worked the gold-mines of Mount Pangæus in the
      vicinity of Philippi, may perhaps be doubtful, but such seems to have been
      the belief of Strabo and Pliny.<a href="#linknote-575"
       name="linknoteref-575" id="linknoteref-575">575</a> Strabo also believed
      that there had been a Semitic element in the population of Euboea which
      had been introduced by Cadmus;<a href="#linknote-576"
       name="linknoteref-576" id="linknoteref-576">576</a> and a Phoenician
      settlement in Boeotia was the current tradition of the Greek writers upon
      primitive times, whether historians or geographers.<a href="#linknote-577"
       name="linknoteref-577" id="linknoteref-577">577</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The further progress of the Phoenician settlements northward into the
      Propontis and the Euxine is a point whereon different opinions may be
      entertained. Pronectus, on the Bithynian, and Amastris, on the
      Paphlagonian coast, have been numbered among the colonies of the
      Phoenicians by some;<a href="#linknote-578" name="linknoteref-578"
       id="linknoteref-578">578</a> while others have gone so far as to ascribe
      to them the colonisation of the entire countries of Bithynia, Mariandynia,
      and Paphlagonia.<a href="#linknote-579" name="linknoteref-579"
       id="linknoteref-579">579</a> The story of the Argonauts may fairly be held
      to show<a href="#linknote-580" name="linknoteref-580" id="linknoteref-580">580</a>
      that Phoenician enterprise early penetrated into the stormy and
      inhospitable sea which washes Asia Minor upon the north, and even reached
      its deepest eastern recess; but it is one thing to sail into seas, and,
      landing where the natives seem friendly, to traffic with the dwellers on
      them&mdash;it is quite another thing to attempt a permanent occupation of
      portions of their coasts. To do so often provokes hostility, and puts a
      stop to trade instead of encouraging it. The Phoenicians may have been
      content to draw their native products from the barbarous tribes of
      Northern Asia Minor and Western Thrace&mdash;nay, even of Southern Scythia&mdash;without
      risking the collisions that might have followed the establishment of
      settlements.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with the Black Sea, so with the Adriatic, the commercial advantages
      were not sufficient to tempt the Phoenicians to colonise. From Crete and
      Cythera they sent their gaze afar, and fixed it midway in the
      Mediterranean, at the western extremity of the eastern basin, on the
      shores of Sicily, and the vast projection from the coast of North Africa
      which goes forth to meet them. They knew the harbourless character of the
      African coast west of Egypt, and the dangers of the Lesser and Greater
      Syrtes. They knew the fertility of the Tunisian projection, the excellence
      of its harbours, and the prolificness of the large island that lay
      directly opposite. Here were the tracts where they might expand freely,
      and which would richly repay their occupation of them. It was before the
      beginning of the eleventh century B.C.&mdash;perhaps some centuries before&mdash;that
      the colonisation of North Africa by the Phoenicians was taken in hand:<a
      href="#linknote-581" name="linknoteref-581" id="linknoteref-581">581</a>
      and about the same time, in all probability, the capes and isles about
      Sicily were occupied,<a href="#linknote-582" name="linknoteref-582"
       id="linknoteref-582">582</a> and Phoenician influence in a little time
      extended over the entire island.
    </p>
    <p>
      In North Africa the first colony planted is said to have been Utica. Utica
      was situated a little to the west of Carthage, at the mouth of the Mejerda
      or Bagradas river.<a href="#linknote-583" name="linknoteref-583"
       id="linknoteref-583">583</a> It stood on a rocky promontory which ran out
      into the sea eastward, and partially protected its harbour. At the
      opposite extremity, towards the north, ran out another promontory, the
      modern Ras Sidi Ali-el-Mekki, while the mouth of the harbour, which faced
      to the south-east, was protected by some islands. At present the deposits
      of the Mejerda have blocked up almost the whole of this ancient port, and
      the rocky eminence upon which the city stood looks down on three sides
      upon a broad alluvial plain, through which the Mejerda pursues a tortuous
      course to the sea.<a href="#linknote-584" name="linknoteref-584"
       id="linknoteref-584">584</a> The remains of the ancient town, which occupy
      the promontory and a peninsula projecting from it, include a necropolis,
      an amphitheatre, a theatre, a castle, the ruins of a temple, and some
      remains of baths; but they have nothing about them bearing any of the
      characteristics of Phoenician architecture, and belong wholly to the Roman
      or post-Roman period. The neighbourhood is productive of olives, which
      yield an excellent oil; and in the hills towards the south-west are veins
      of lead, containing a percentage of silver, which are thought to bear
      traces of having been worked at a very early date.<a href="#linknote-585"
       name="linknoteref-585" id="linknoteref-585">585</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Near Utica was founded, probably not many years later, the settlement of
      Hippo-Zaritis, of which the name still seems to linger in the modern
      Bizerta. Hippo-Zaritis stood on the west bank of a natural channel, which
      united with the sea a considerable lagoon or salt lake, lying south of the
      town. The channel was kept open by an irregular flux and reflux, the water
      of the lake after the rainy season flowing off into the sea, and that of
      the sea, correspondingly, in the dry season passing into the lake.<a
      href="#linknote-586" name="linknoteref-586" id="linknoteref-586">586</a>
      At the present time the lake is extraordinarily productive of fish,<a
      href="#linknote-587" name="linknoteref-587" id="linknoteref-587">587</a>
      and the sea outside yields coral;<a href="#linknote-588"
       name="linknoteref-588" id="linknoteref-588">588</a> but otherwise the
      advantages of the situation are not great.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two degrees further to the west, on a hill overlooking the sea, and
      commanding a lovely prospect over the verdant plain at its base, watered
      by numerous streams, was founded the colony of Hippo Regius, memorable as
      having been for five-and-thirty years the residence of St. Augustine. The
      Phoenicians were probably attracted to the site by the fertility of the
      soil, the unfailing supplies of water, and the abundant timber and rich
      iron ore of the neighbouring mountains.<a href="#linknote-589"
       name="linknoteref-589" id="linknoteref-589">589</a> Hippo Regius is now
      Bona, or rather has been replaced by that town, which lies about a mile
      and a half north of the ancient Hippo, close upon the coast, in the
      fertile tract formed by the soil brought down by the river Seybouse. The
      old harbour of Hippo is filled up, and the remains of the ancient city are
      scanty; but the lovely gardens and orchards, which render Bona one of the
      most agreeable of Algerian towns, sufficiently explain and justify the
      Phoenician choice of the site.<a href="#linknote-590"
       name="linknoteref-590" id="linknoteref-590">590</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same bay with Utica, further to the south, and near its inner
      recess, was founded, nearly three centuries after Utica, the most
      important of all the Phoenician colonies, Carthage. The advantages of the
      locality are indicated by the fact that the chief town of Northern Africa,
      Tunis, has grown up within a short distance of the site. It combined the
      excellences of a sheltered situation, a good soil, defensible eminences,
      and harbours which a little art made all that was to be desired in ancient
      times and with ancient navies. These basins, partly natural, partly
      artificial, still exist;<a href="#linknote-591" name="linknoteref-591"
       id="linknoteref-591">591</a> but their communication with the sea is
      blocked up, as also is the channel which connected the military harbour
      with the harbours of commerce. The remains of the ancient town are mostly
      beneath the surface of the soil, but modern research has uncovered a
      portion of them, and brought to light a certain number of ruins which
      belong probably to the very earliest period. Among these are walls in the
      style called &ldquo;Cyclopian,&rdquo; built of a very hard material, and more than
      thirty-two feet thick, which seem to have surrounded the ancient Byrsa or
      citadel, and which are still in places sixteen feet high.<a
      href="#linknote-592" name="linknoteref-592" id="linknoteref-592">592</a>
      The Roman walls found emplaced above these are of far inferior strength
      and solidity. An extensive necropolis lies north of the ancient town, on
      the coast near Cape Camart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another early and important Phoenician settlement in these parts was
      Hadrumetum or Adrymes,<a href="#linknote-593" name="linknoteref-593"
       id="linknoteref-593">593</a> which seems to be represented by the modern
      Soûsa. Hadrumetum lay on the eastern side of the great Tunisian
      projection, near the southern extremity of a large bay which looks to the
      east, and is now known as the Gulf of Hammamet. Its position was upon the
      coast at the edge of the vast plain called at present the &ldquo;Sahel of
      Soûsa,&rdquo; which is sandy, but immensely productive of olive oil. &ldquo;Millions
      of olive-trees,&rdquo; it is said, &ldquo;cover the tract,"<a href="#linknote-594"
       name="linknoteref-594" id="linknoteref-594">594</a> and the present annual
      exportation amounts to 40,000 hectolitres.<a href="#linknote-595"
       name="linknoteref-595" id="linknoteref-595">595</a> Ancient remains are
      few, but the Cothon, or circular harbour, may still be traced, and in the
      necropolis, which almost wholly encircles the town, many sepulchral
      chambers have been found, excavated in the chalk, closely resembling in
      their arrangements those of the Phoenician mainland.
    </p>
    <p>
      South of Hadrumetum, at no great distance, was Leptis Minor, now Lemta.
      The gulf of Hammamet terminates southwards in the promontory of Monastir,
      between which and Ras Dimas is a shallow bay looking to the north-east.
      Here was the Lesser Leptis, so called to distinguish it from the larger
      city of the same name between the Lesser and the Greater Syrtis; it was,
      however, a considerable town, as appears from its remains. These lie along
      the coast for two miles and a half in Lat. 35º 43´, and include the ruins
      of an aqueduct, of a theatre, of quays, and of jetties.<a
      href="#linknote-596" name="linknoteref-596" id="linknoteref-596">596</a>
      The neighbourhood is suited for the cultivation of the olive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Greater Leptis (Leptis Major) lay at a considerable distance from the
      Lesser one. Midway in the low African coast which intervenes between the
      Tunisian projection and the Cyrenaic one, about Long. 14º 22´ E. of
      Greenwich, are ruins, near a village called Lebda, which, it is generally
      agreed, mark the site of this ancient city. Leptis Major was a colony from
      Sidon, and occupied originally a small promontory, which projects from the
      coast in a north-easterly direction, and attains a moderate elevation
      above the plain at its base. Towards the mainland it was defended by a
      triple line of wall still to be traced, and on the sea-side by blocks of
      enormous strength, which are said to resemble those on the western side of
      the island of Aradus.<a href="#linknote-597" name="linknoteref-597"
       id="linknoteref-597">597</a> In Roman times the town, under the name of
      Neapolis,<a href="#linknote-598" name="linknoteref-598"
       id="linknoteref-598">598</a> attained a vast size, and was adorned with
      magnificent edifices, of which there are still numerous remains. The
      neighbourhood is rich in palm-groves and olive-groves,<a
      href="#linknote-599" name="linknoteref-599" id="linknoteref-599">599</a>
      and the Cinyps region, regarded by Herodotus as the most fertile in North
      Africa,<a href="#linknote-5100" name="linknoteref-5100"       id="linknoteref-5100">5100</a> lies at no great distance to the east.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten miles east, and a little south of Leptis Minor,<a href="#linknote-5101"       name="linknoteref-5101" id="linknoteref-5101">5101</a> was Thapsus, a
      small town, but one of great strength, famous as the scene of Julius
      Cæsar&rsquo;s great victory over Cato.<a href="#linknote-5102"       name="linknoteref-5102" id="linknoteref-5102">5102</a> It occupied a
      position close to the promontory now known as Ras Dimas, in Lat. 35º 39´,
      Long. 11º 3´, and was defended by a triple enclosure, whereof considerable
      remains are still existing. The outermost of the three lines appears to
      have consisted of little more than a ditch and a palisaded rampart, such
      as the Romans were accustomed to throw up whenever they pitched a camp in
      their wars; but the second and third were more substantial. The second,
      which was about forty yards behind the first, was guarded by a deeper
      ditch, from which rose a perpendicular stone wall, battlemented at top.
      The third, forty yards further back, resembled the second, but was on an
      enlarged scale, and the wall was twenty feet thick.<a href="#linknote-5103"       name="linknoteref-5103" id="linknoteref-5103">5103</a> Such triple
      enclosures are thought to be traceable in other Phoenician settlements
      also;<a href="#linknote-5104" name="linknoteref-5104" id="linknoteref-5104">5104</a>
      but in no case are the remains so perfect as at Thapsus. The harbour,
      which lay south of the town, was protected from the prevalent northern and
      north-eastern winds by a huge mole or jetty, carried out originally to a
      distance of 450 yards from the shore, and still measuring 325 yards. The
      foundation consists of piles driven into the sand, and placed very close
      together; but the superstructure is a stone wall thirty-five feet thick,
      and still rising to a height of ten feet above the surface of the water.<a
      href="#linknote-5105" name="linknoteref-5105" id="linknoteref-5105">5105</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is probable that there were many other early Phoenician settlements on
      the North African seaboard; but those already described were certainly the
      most important. The fertile coast tract between Hippo Regius and the
      straits is likely to have been occupied at various points from an early
      period. But none of these small trading settlements attained to any
      celebrity; and thus it is unnecessary to go into particulars respecting
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Sicily the permanent Phoenician settlements were chiefly towards the
      west and the north-west. They included Motya, Eryx, Panormus (Palermo),
      and Soloeis. That the Phoenicians founded Motya, Panormus, and Soloeis is
      distinctly stated by Thucydides;<a href="#linknote-5106"       name="linknoteref-5106" id="linknoteref-5106">5106</a> while Eryx is
      proved to have been Phoenician by its remains. Motya, situated on a
      littoral island less than half a mile from the western shore, in Lat. 38º
      nearly, has the remains of a wall built of large stones, uncemented, in
      the Phoenician manner,<a href="#linknote-5107" name="linknoteref-5107"       id="linknoteref-5107">5107</a> and carried, like the western wall of
      Aradus, so close to the coast as to be washed by the waves. It is said by
      Diodorus to have been at one time a most flourishing town.<a
      href="#linknote-5108" name="linknoteref-5108" id="linknoteref-5108">5108</a>
      The coins have Phoenician legends.<a href="#linknote-5109"       name="linknoteref-5109" id="linknoteref-5109">5109</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Eryx lay about seven miles to the north-east of Motya, in a very strong
      position. Mount Eryx (now Mount Giuliano), on which it was mainly built,
      rises to the height of two thousand feet above the plain,<a
      href="#linknote-5110" name="linknoteref-5110" id="linknoteref-5110">5110</a>
      and, being encircled by a strong wall, was rendered almost impregnable.
      The summit was levelled and turned into a platform, on which was raised
      the temple of Astarte or Venus.<a href="#linknote-5111"       name="linknoteref-5111" id="linknoteref-5111">5111</a> An excellent
      harbour, formed by Cape Drepanum (now Trapani), lay at its base. There
      were springs of water within the walls which yielded an unfailing supply.
      The walls were of great strength, and a considerable portion of them is
      still standing, and attests the skill of the Phoenician architects. The
      blocks in the lower courses are mostly of a large size, some of them six
      feet long, or more, and bear in many cases the well-known Phoenician

      Aradus and Sidon, and recall the style of the Aradian builders, but are at
      once less massive and arranged with more skill. The breadth of the wall is
      about seven feet. At intervals it is flanked by square towers projecting
      from it, which are of even greater strength than the curtain between them,
      and which were carried up to a greater height. The doorways in the wall
      are numerous, and are of a very archaic character, being either covered in
      by a single long stone lintel or else terminating in a false arch.<a
      href="#linknote-5113" name="linknoteref-5113" id="linknoteref-5113">5113</a>
      The commercial advantages of Eryx were twofold, consisting in the produce
      of the sea as well as in that of the shore. The shore is well suited for
      the cultivation of the vine,<a href="#linknote-5114"       name="linknoteref-5114" id="linknoteref-5114">5114</a> while the
      neighbouring sea yields tunny-fish, sponges, and coral.<a

      Panormus (now Palermo) occupies a site almost unequalled by any other
      Mediterranean city, a site which has conferred upon it the title of &ldquo;the
      happy,&rdquo; and has rendered it for above a thousand years the most important
      place in the island. &ldquo;There is no town in Europe which enjoys a more
      delicious climate, none so charming to look on from a distance, none more
      delightfully situated in a nest of verdure and flowers. Its superb
      mountains, with their bare flanks pierced along their base with grottoes,
      enclose a marvellous garden, the famous &lsquo;Shell of Gold,&rsquo; in the midst of
      which are seen the numerous towers and domes, the fan-like foliage of the
      palms, the spreading branches of the pines, and Mount Reale on the south
      towering over all with its vast mass of convents and churches."<a
      href="#linknote-5116" name="linknoteref-5116" id="linknoteref-5116">5116</a>
      The harbour lies open to the north; but the Phoenician settlers, here as
      elsewhere, no doubt made artificial ports by means of piers and moles,
      which have, however, disappeared on this much-frequented site, where
      generation after generation has been continually at work building and
      destroying. Panormus has left us no antique remains beyond its coins,
      which are abundant, and show that the native name of the settlement was
      Mahanath.<a href="#linknote-5117" name="linknoteref-5117"       id="linknoteref-5117">5117</a> Mahanath was situated about forty miles
      east of Eryx, on the northern coast of the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solus, or Soloeis, the Soluntum of the Romans (now Solanto), lay on the
      eastern side of the promontory (Cape Zafferana) which shuts in the bay of
      Palermo on the right. It stood on a slope at the foot of a lofty hill,
      overlooking a small round port, and was fortified by a wall of large
      squared blocks of stone,<a href="#linknote-5118" name="linknoteref-5118"       id="linknoteref-5118">5118</a> which may be still distinctly traced. The
      site has yielded sarcophagi of an unmistakably Phoenician character,<a
      href="#linknote-5119" name="linknoteref-5119" id="linknoteref-5119">5119</a>
      and other objects of a high antiquity which recall the Phoenician manner;<a
      href="#linknote-5120" name="linknoteref-5120" id="linknoteref-5120">5120</a>
      but the chief remains belong to the Greco-Roman times.
    </p>
    <p>
      The islands in the strait which separates the North African coast from
      Sicily were also colonised by the Phoenicians. These were three in number,
      Cossura (now Pantellaria), Gaulos (now Gozzo), and Melita (now Malta).
      Cossura, the most western of the three, lay about midway in the channel,
      but nearer to the African coast, from which it is distant not more than
      about thirty-five miles. It is a mass of igneous rock, which was once a
      volcano, and which still abounds in hot springs and in jets of steam.<a
      href="#linknote-5121" name="linknoteref-5121" id="linknoteref-5121">5121</a>
      There was no natural harbour of any size, but the importance of the
      position was such that the Phoenicians felt bound to occupy the island, if
      only to prevent its occupation by others. The soil was sterile; but the
      coins, which are very numerous,<a href="#linknote-5122"       name="linknoteref-5122" id="linknoteref-5122">5122</a> give reason to
      suppose that the rocks were in early times rich in copper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gaulos (now Gozzo) forms, together with Malta and some islets, an insular
      group lying between the eastern part of Sicily and the Lesser Syrtis. It
      is situated in Lat. 36º 2´, Long. 12º 10´ nearly, and is distant from
      Sicily only about fifty miles. The colonisation of the island by the
      Phoenicians, asserted by Diodorus,<a href="#linknote-5123"       name="linknoteref-5123" id="linknoteref-5123">5123</a> is entirely borne
      out by the remains, which include a Phoenician inscription of some length,<a
      href="#linknote-5124" name="linknoteref-5124" id="linknoteref-5124">5124</a>
      coins with Phoenician legends,<a href="#linknote-5125"       name="linknoteref-5125" id="linknoteref-5125">5125</a> and buildings,
      believed to be temples, which have Phoenician characteristics.<a
      href="#linknote-5126" name="linknoteref-5126" id="linknoteref-5126">5126</a>
      Some of the blocks of stone employed in their construction have a length
      of nearly twenty feet,<a href="#linknote-5127" name="linknoteref-5127"       id="linknoteref-5127">5127</a> with a width and height proportionate; and
      all are put together without cement or mortar of any kind. A conical stone
      of the kind known to have been used by the Phoenicians in their worship
      was found in one of the temples.<a href="#linknote-5128"       name="linknoteref-5128" id="linknoteref-5128">5128</a> Gaulos had a port
      which was reckoned sufficiently commodious, and which lay probably towards
      the south-east end of the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Melita, or Malta, which lies at a short distance from Gozzo, to the
      south-east, is an island of more than double the size, and of far greater
      importance. It possesses in La Valetta one of the best harbours, or rather
      two of the best harbours, in the world. All the navies of Europe could
      anchor comfortably in the &ldquo;great port&rdquo; to the east of the town. The
      western port is smaller, but is equally well sheltered. Malta has no
      natural product of much importance, unless it be the honey, after which
      some think that it was named.<a href="#linknote-5129"       name="linknoteref-5129" id="linknoteref-5129">5129</a> The island is
      almost treeless, and the light powdery soil gives small promise of
      fertility. Still, the actual produce, both in cereals and in green crops,
      is large; and the oranges, especially those known as mandarines, are of
      superior quality. Malta also produced, in ancient as in modern times, the
      remarkable breed of small dogs<a href="#linknote-5130"       name="linknoteref-5130" id="linknoteref-5130">5130</a> which is still held
      in such high esteem. But the Phoenician colonisation must have taken place
      rather on account of the situation and the harbour than on account of the
      products.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Sicily and North Africa the tide of emigration naturally and easily
      flowed on into Sardinia, which is distant, from the former about 150 and
      from the latter about 115 miles. The points chosen by the Phoenician
      settlers lay in the more open and level region of the south and the
      south-west, and were all enclosed within a line which might be drawn from
      the coast a little east of Cagliari to the northern extremity of the Gulf
      of Oristano.<a href="#linknote-5131" name="linknoteref-5131"       id="linknoteref-5131">5131</a> The tract includes some mountain groups,
      but consists mainly of the long and now marshy plain, called the
      &ldquo;Campidano,&rdquo; which reaches across the island from Cagliari on the southern
      to Oristano on the western coast. This plain, if drained, would be by far
      the most fertile part of the island; and was in ancient times exceedingly
      productive in cereals, as we learn from Diodorus.<a href="#linknote-5132"       name="linknoteref-5132" id="linknoteref-5132">5132</a> The mountains west
      of it, especially those about Iglesias, contain rich veins of copper and
      of lead, together with a certain quantity of silver.<a
      href="#linknote-5133" name="linknoteref-5133" id="linknoteref-5133">5133</a>
      Good harbours exist at Cagliari, at Oristano, and between the island of S.
      Antioco and the western shore. It was at these points especially that the
      Phoenicians made their settlements, the most important of which were
      Caralis (Cagliari), Nora, Sulcis, and Tharros. Caralis, or Cagliari, the
      present capital, lies at the bottom of a deep bay looking southwards, and
      has an excellent harbour, sheltered in all weathers. There are no remains
      of Phoenician buildings; but the neighbourhood yields abundant specimens
      of Phoenician art in the shape of tombs, statuettes, vases, bottles, and
      the like.<a href="#linknote-5134" name="linknoteref-5134"       id="linknoteref-5134">5134</a> Caralis was probably the first of the
      settlements made by the Phoenicians in Sardinia; it would attract them by
      its harbour, its mines, and the fertility of its neighbourhood. From
      Caralis they probably passed to Nora, which lay on the same bay to the
      south-west; and from Nora they rounded the south-western promontory of
      Sardinia, and established themselves on the small island now known as the
      Isola di San Antioco, where they built a town which they called Sulchis or
      Sulcis.<a href="#linknote-5135" name="linknoteref-5135"       id="linknoteref-5135">5135</a> Sulcis has yielded votive tablets of the
      Phoenician type, tombs, vases, &amp;c.<a href="#linknote-5136"       name="linknoteref-5136" id="linknoteref-5136">5136</a> The island was
      productive of lead, and had an excellent harbour towards the north, and
      another more open one towards the south. Finally, mid-way on the west
      coast, at the northern extremity of the Gulf of Oristano, the Phoenicians
      occupied a small promontory which projects into the sea southwards and
      there formed a settlement which became known as Tharras or Tharros.<a
      href="#linknote-5137" name="linknoteref-5137" id="linknoteref-5137">5137</a>
      Very extensive remains, quite unmistakably Phoenician, including tombs,
      cippi, statuettes in metal and clay, weapons, and the like, have been
      found on the site.<a href="#linknote-5138" name="linknoteref-5138"       id="linknoteref-5138">5138</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The passage would have been easy from Sardinia to Corsica, which is not
      more than seven miles distant from it; but Corsica seems to have possessed
      no attraction for the Phoenicians proper, who were perhaps deterred from
      colonising it by its unhealthiness, or by the savagery of its inhabitants.
      Or they may have feared to provoke the jealousy of the Tyrrhenians, off
      whose coast the island lay, and who, without having any colonising spirit
      themselves, disliked the too near approach of rivals.<a
      href="#linknote-5139" name="linknoteref-5139" id="linknoteref-5139">5139</a>
      At any rate, whatever the cause, it seems to have been left to the
      Carthaginians, to bring Corsica within the range of Phoenician influence;
      and even the Carthaginians did little more than hold a few points on its
      shores as stations for their ships.<a href="#linknote-5140"       name="linknoteref-5140" id="linknoteref-5140">5140</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      If from Sardinia the Phoenicians ventured on an exploring voyage westward
      into the open Mediterranean, a day&rsquo;s sail would bring them within sight of
      the eastern Balearic Islands, Minorca and Majorca. The sierra of Majorca
      rises to the height of between 3,000 and 4,000 feet,<a
      href="#linknote-5141" name="linknoteref-5141" id="linknoteref-5141">5141</a>
      and can be seen from a great distance. The occupation of the islands by
      &ldquo;the Phoenicians&rdquo; is asserted by Strabo,<a href="#linknote-5142"       name="linknoteref-5142" id="linknoteref-5142">5142</a> but we cannot be
      sure that he does not mean Phoenicians of Africa, i.e. Carthaginians.
      Still, on the whole, modern criticism inclines to the belief that, even
      before the foundation of Carthage, Phoenician colonisation had made its
      way into the Balearic Islands, directly, from the Syrian coast.<a
      href="#linknote-5143" name="linknoteref-5143" id="linknoteref-5143">5143</a>
      Some resting-places between the middle Mediterranean and Southern Spain
      must have been a necessity; and as the North African coast west of Hippo
      offered no good harbours, it was necessary to seek them elsewhere. Now
      Minorca has in Port Mahon a harbour of almost unsurpassed excellence,<a
      href="#linknote-5144" name="linknoteref-5144" id="linknoteref-5144">5144</a>
      while in Majorca there are fairly good ports both at Palma and at Aleudia.<a
      href="#linknote-5145" name="linknoteref-5145" id="linknoteref-5145">5145</a>
      Ivica is less well provided, but there is one of some size, known as
      Pormany (i.e. &ldquo;Porta magna&rdquo;), on the western side of the island, and
      another, much frequented by fishing-boats,<a href="#linknote-5146"       name="linknoteref-5146" id="linknoteref-5146">5146</a> on the south coast
      near Ibiza. The productions of the Balearides were not, perhaps, in the
      early times of much importance, since the islands are not, like Sardinia,
      rich in metals, nor were the inhabitants sufficiently civilised to furnish
      food supplies or native manufactures in any quantity. If, then, the
      Phoenicians held them, it must have been altogether for the sake of their
      harbours.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonies of the Mediterranean have now been, all of them, noticed,
      excepting those which lay upon the south coast of Spain. Of these the most
      important were Malaca (now Malaga), Sex or Sexti, and Abdera (now Adra).
      Malaca is said by Strabo to have been &ldquo;Phoenician in its plan,"<a
      href="#linknote-5147" name="linknoteref-5147" id="linknoteref-5147">5147</a>
      Abdera is expressly declared by him to have been &ldquo;a Phoenician
      settlement,"<a href="#linknote-5148" name="linknoteref-5148"       id="linknoteref-5148">5148</a> while Sexti has coins which connect it with
      early Phoenician legends.<a href="#linknote-5149" name="linknoteref-5149"       id="linknoteref-5149">5149</a> The mountain range above Malaca was
      anciently rich in gold-mines;<a href="#linknote-5150"       name="linknoteref-5150" id="linknoteref-5150">5150</a> Sexti was famous
      for its salt-pans;<a href="#linknote-5151" name="linknoteref-5151"       id="linknoteref-5151">5151</a> Abdera lay in the neighbourhood of
      productive silver-mines.<a href="#linknote-5152" name="linknoteref-5152"       id="linknoteref-5152">5152</a> These were afterwards worked from
      Carthagena, which was a late Carthaginian colony, founded by Asdrubal, the
      uncle of Hannibal. Malaga and Carthagena (i.e. New-Town) had
      well-sheltered harbours; but the ports of Sexti and Abdera were
      indifferent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the Straits of Gibraltar, on the shores of the Atlantic, were two
      further sets of Phoenician colonies, situated respectively in Africa and
      in Spain. The most important of those in Africa were Tingis (now Tangiers)
      and Lixus (now Chemmish), but besides these there were a vast number of
      staples ({emporia}) without names,<a href="#linknote-5153"       name="linknoteref-5153" id="linknoteref-5153">5153</a> spread along the
      coast as far as Cape Non, opposite the Canary Islands. Tingis, a second
      Gibraltar, lay nearly opposite that wonderful rock, but a little west of
      the narrowest part of the strait. It had a temple of the Tyrian Hercules,
      said to have been older than that at Gades;<a href="#linknote-5154"       name="linknoteref-5154" id="linknoteref-5154">5154</a> and its coins have
      Phoenician legends.<a href="#linknote-5155" name="linknoteref-5155"       id="linknoteref-5155">5155</a> The town was situated on a promontory
      running out to the north-east at the extremity of a semicircular bay about
      four miles in width, and thus possessed a harbour not to be despised,
      especially on such a coast. The country around was at once beautiful and
      fertile, dotted over with palms, and well calculated for the growth of
      fruit and vegetables. The Atlas mountains rose in the background, with
      their picturesque summits, while in front were seen the blue
      Mediterranean, with its crisp waves merging into the wilder Atlantic, and
      further off the shores of Spain, lying like a blue film on the northern
      horizon.<a href="#linknote-5156" name="linknoteref-5156"       id="linknoteref-5156">5156</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      While Tingis lay at the junction of the two seas, on the northern African
      coast, about five miles east of Cape Spartel, Lixus was situated on the
      open Atlantic, forty miles to the south of that cape, on the West African
      coast, looking westward towards the ocean. The streams from Atlas here
      collect into a considerable river, known now as the Wady-el-Khous, and
      anciently as the Lixus.<a href="#linknote-5157" name="linknoteref-5157"       id="linknoteref-5157">5157</a> The estuary of this river, before reaching
      the sea, meanders through the plain of Sidi Oueddar, from time to time
      returning upon itself, and forming peninsulas, which are literally almost
      islands.<a href="#linknote-5158" name="linknoteref-5158"       id="linknoteref-5158">5158</a> From this plain, between two of the great
      bends made by the stream, rose in one place a rocky hill; and here the
      Phoenicians built their town, protecting it along the brow of the hill
      with a strong wall, portions of which still remain in place.<a
      href="#linknote-5159" name="linknoteref-5159" id="linknoteref-5159">5159</a>
      The blocks are squared, carefully dressed, and arranged in horizontal
      courses, without any cement. Some of them are as much as eleven feet long
      by six feet or somewhat more in height. The wall was flanked at the
      corners by square towers, and formed a sort of irregular hexagon, above a
      mile in circumference.<a href="#linknote-5160" name="linknoteref-5160"       id="linknoteref-5160">5160</a> A large building within the walls seems to
      have been a temple;<a href="#linknote-5161" name="linknoteref-5161"       id="linknoteref-5161">5161</a> and in it was found one of those remarkable
      conical stones which are known to have been employed in the Phoenician
      worship. The estuary of the river formed a tolerably safe harbour for the
      Phoenician ships, and the valley down which the river flows gave a ready
      access into the interior.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Spain, outside the Pillars of Hercules, the chief Phoenician
      settlements were Tartessus, Agadir or Gades, and Belon. Tartessus has been
      regarded by some as properly the name of a country rather than a town;<a
      href="#linknote-5162" name="linknoteref-5162" id="linknoteref-5162">5162</a>
      but the statements of the Greek and Roman geographers to the contrary are
      too positive to be disregarded. Tartessus was a town in the opinions of
      Scymnus Chius, Strabo, Mela, Pliny, Festus Avienus, and Pausanias,<a
      href="#linknote-5163" name="linknoteref-5163" id="linknoteref-5163">5163</a>
      who could not be, all of them, mistaken on such a point. It was a town
      named from, or at any rate bearing the same name with, an important river
      of southern Spain,<a href="#linknote-5164" name="linknoteref-5164"       id="linknoteref-5164">5164</a> probably the Guadalquivir. It was not
      Gades, for Scymnus Chius mentions both cities as existing in his day;<a
      href="#linknote-5165" name="linknoteref-5165" id="linknoteref-5165">5165</a>
      it was not Carteia, for it lay west of Gades, while Carteia lay east.
      Probably it occupied, as Strabo thought, a small island between two arms
      of the Guadalquivir, and gradually decayed as Gades rose to importance. It
      certainly did not exist in Strabo&rsquo;s time, but five or six centuries
      earlier it was a most flourishing place.<a href="#linknote-5166"       name="linknoteref-5166" id="linknoteref-5166">5166</a> If it is the
      Tarshish of Scripture, its prosperity and importance must have been even
      anterior to the time of Solomon, whose &ldquo;navy of Tarshish&rdquo; brought him once
      in every three years &ldquo;gold, and silver, and ivory, and apes, and
      peacocks."<a href="#linknote-5167" name="linknoteref-5167"       id="linknoteref-5167">5167</a> The south of Spain was rich in metallic
      treasures, and yielded gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, and tin;<a
      href="#linknote-5168" name="linknoteref-5168" id="linknoteref-5168">5168</a>
      trade along the west coast of Africa would bring in the ivory and apes
      abundant in that region; while the birds called in our translation of the
      Bible &ldquo;peacocks&rdquo; may have been guinea-fowl. The country on either side of
      the Guadalquivir to a considerable distance took its name from the city,
      being called Tartessis.<a href="#linknote-5169" name="linknoteref-5169"       id="linknoteref-5169">5169</a> It was immensely productive. &ldquo;The wide
      plains through which the Guadalquiver flows produced the finest wheat,
      yielding an increase of a hundredfold; the oil and the wine, the growth of
      the hills, were equally distinguished for their excellence. The wood was
      not less remarkable for its fineness than in modern times, and had a
      native colour beautiful without dye."<a href="#linknote-5170"       name="linknoteref-5170" id="linknoteref-5170">5170</a> Nor were the
      neighbouring sea and stream less bountiful. The tunny was caught in large
      quantities off the coast, shell-fish were abundant and of unusual size,<a
      href="#linknote-5171" name="linknoteref-5171" id="linknoteref-5171">5171</a>
      while huge eels were sometimes taken by the fishermen, which, when salted,
      formed an article of commerce, and were reckoned a delicacy at Athenian
      tables.<a href="#linknote-5172" name="linknoteref-5172"       id="linknoteref-5172">5172</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Gades is said to have been founded by colonists from Tyre a few years
      anterior to the foundation of Utica by the same people.<a
      href="#linknote-5173" name="linknoteref-5173" id="linknoteref-5173">5173</a>
      Utica, as we have seen, dated from the twelfth century before Christ. The
      site of Gades combined all the advantages that the Phoenicians desired for
      their colonies. Near the mouth of the Guadalete there detaches itself from
      the coast of Spain an island eleven miles in length, known now as the
      &ldquo;Isla de Leon,&rdquo; which is separated from the mainland for half its length
      by a narrow but navigable channel, while to this there succeeds on the
      north an ample bay, divided into two portions, a northern and a southern.<a
      href="#linknote-5174" name="linknoteref-5174" id="linknoteref-5174">5174</a>
      The southern, or interior recess, is completely sheltered from all winds;
      the northern lies open to the west, but is so full of creeks, coves, and
      estuaries as to offer a succession of fairly good ports, one or other of
      which would always be accessible. The southern half of the island is from
      one to four miles broad; but the northern consists of a long spit of land
      running out to the north-west, in places not more than a furlong in width,
      but expanding at its northern extremity to a breadth of nearly two miles.
      The long isthmus, and the peninsula in which it ends, have been compared
      to the stalk and blossom of a flower.<a href="#linknote-5175"       name="linknoteref-5175" id="linknoteref-5175">5175</a> The flower was the
      ancient Gades, the modern Cadiz. The Phoenician occupation of the site is
      witnessed to by Strabo, Diodorus, Scymnus Chius, Mela, Pliny, Velleius
      Paterculus, Ælian and Arrian,<a href="#linknote-5176"       name="linknoteref-5176" id="linknoteref-5176">5176</a> and is further
      evidenced by the numerous coins which bear the legend of &ldquo;Agadir&rdquo; in
      Phoenician characters.<a href="#linknote-5177" name="linknoteref-5177"       id="linknoteref-5177">5177</a> But the place itself retains no traces of
      the Phoenician occupation. The famous temple of Melkarth, with its two
      bronze pillars in front bearing inscriptions, has wholly perished, as have
      all other vestiges of the ancient buildings. This is the result of the
      continuous occupation of the site, which has been built on successively by
      Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Vandals, Moors, and Spaniards. The
      space is somewhat confined, and the houses in ancient times were, we are
      told, closely crowded together,<a href="#linknote-5178"       name="linknoteref-5178" id="linknoteref-5178">5178</a> as they were at
      Aradus and Tyre. But the advantages of the harbour and the productiveness
      of the vicinity more than made up for this inconvenience. Gades may have
      been, as Cadiz is now said to be, &ldquo;a mere silver plate set down upon the
      edge of the sea,"<a href="#linknote-5179" name="linknoteref-5179"       id="linknoteref-5179">5179</a> but it was the natural centre of an
      enormous traffic. It had easy access by the valley of a large stream to
      the interior with its rich mineral and vegetable products; it had the
      command of two seas, the Atlantic and the Mediterranean; it trained its
      sailors to affront greater perils than any which the Mediterranean offers;
      and it enjoyed naturally by its position an almost exclusive commerce with
      the Northern Atlantic, with the western coasts of Spain and Gaul, with
      Britain, North Germany, and the Baltic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compared with Gades and Tartessus, Belon was an insignificant settlement.
      Its name<a href="#linknote-5180" name="linknoteref-5180"       id="linknoteref-5180">5180</a> and coins<a href="#linknote-5181"       name="linknoteref-5181" id="linknoteref-5181">5181</a> mark it as
      Phoenician, but it was not possessed of any special advantages of
      situation. The modern Bolonia, a little south of Cadiz, is thought to mark
      the site.<a href="#linknote-5182" name="linknoteref-5182"       id="linknoteref-5182">5182</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      We have reached now the limits of Phoenician colonisation towards the
      West. While their trade was carried, especially from Gades, into
      Luisitania and Gallæcia on the one hand, and into North-western Africa on
      the other, reaching onward past these districts to Gaul and Britain, to
      the Senegal and Gambia, possibly to the Baltic and the Fortunate Islands,
      the range of their settlements was more circumscribed. As, towards the
      north-east, though their trade embraced the regions of Colchis and Thrace,
      of the Tauric Chersonese, and Southern Scythia, their settlements were
      limited to the Ægean and perhaps the Propontis, so westward they seem to
      have contented themselves with occupying a few points of vantage on the
      Spanish and West African coasts, at no great distance from the Straits,
      and from these stations to have sent out their commercial navies to sweep
      the seas and gather in the products of the lands which lay at a greater
      distance. The actual extent of their trade will be considered in a later
      chapter. We have been here concerned only with their permanent settlements
      or colonies. These, it has been seen, extended from the Syrian coast to
      Cyprus, Cilicia, Rhodes, Crete, the islands and shores of the Ægean and
      Propontis, the coasts of Sicily, Sardinia, and North Africa, the Balearic
      Islands, Southern Spain, and North-western Africa as far south as Cape
      Non. The colonisation was not so continuous as the Greek, nor was it so
      extensive in one direction,<a href="#linknote-5183" name="linknoteref-5183"       id="linknoteref-5183">5183</a> but on the whole it was wider, and it was
      far bolder and more adventurous. The Greeks, as a general rule, made their
      advances by slow degrees, stealing on from point to point, and having
      always friendly cities near at hand, like an army that rests on its
      supports. The Phoenicians left long intervals of space between one
      settlement and another, boldly planted them on barbarous shores, where
      they had nothing to rely on but themselves, and carried them into regions
      where the natives were in a state of almost savagery. The commercial
      motive was predominant with them, and gave them the courage to plunge into
      wild seas and venture themselves among even wilder men. With the Greeks
      the motive was generally political, and a safe home was sought, where
      social and civil life might have free scope for quiet development.

     Summary.
</pre>
    <p>
      The architecture of the Phoenicians began with the fashioning of the
      native rock&mdash;so abundant in all parts of the country where they had
      settled themselves&mdash;into dwellings, temples, and tombs. The
      calcareous limestone, which is the chief geological formation along the
      Syrian coast, is worked with great ease; and it contains numerous fissures
      and caverns,<a href="#linknote-61" name="linknoteref-61"
       id="linknoteref-61">61</a> which a very moderate amount of labour and
      skill is capable of converting into fairly comfortable dwelling-places. It
      is probable that the first settlers found a refuge for a time in these
      natural grottos, which after a while they proceeded to improve and
      enlarge, thus obtaining a practical power of dealing with the material,
      and an experimental knowledge of its advantages and defects. But it was
      not long before these simple dwellings ceased to content them, and they
      were seized with an ambition to construct more elaborate edifices&mdash;edifices
      such as they must have seen in the lands through which they had passed on
      their way from the shores of the Persian Gulf to the seaboard of the
      Mediterranean. They could not at once, however, divest themselves of their
      acquired habits, and consequently, their earliest buildings continued to
      have, in part, the character of rock dwellings, while in part they were
      constructions of the more ordinary and regular type. The remains of a
      dwelling-house at Amrith,<a href="#linknote-62" name="linknoteref-62"
       id="linknoteref-62">62</a> the ancient Marathus, offer a remarkable
      example of this intermixture of styles. The rock has been cut away so as
      to leave standing two parallel walls 33 yards long, 19 feet high, and 2
      1/2 feet thick, which are united by transverse party-walls formed in the
      same way.<a href="#linknote-63" name="linknoteref-63" id="linknoteref-63">63</a>
      Windows and doorways are cut in the walls, some square at top, some
      arched. At the two ends the main walls were united partly by the native
      rock, partly by masonry. The northern wall was built of masonry from the
      very foundation, the southern consisted for a portion of its height of the
      native rock, while above that were several courses of stones carrying it
      up further. At Aradus and at Sidon, similarly, the town walls are formed
      in many places of native rock, squared and smoothed, up to a certain
      height, after which courses of stone succeed each other in the ordinary
      fashion. It is as if the Phoenician builders could not break themselves of
      an inveterate habit, and rather than disuse it entirely submitted to an
      intermixture which was not without a certain amount of awkwardness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another striking example of the mixed system is found at a little distance
      from Amrith, in the case of a building which appears to have been a
      shrine, tabernacle, or sanctuary. The site is a rocky platform, about a
      mile from the shore. Here the rock has been cut away to a depth varying
      from three to six yards, and a rectangular court has been formed, 180 feet
      long by 156 feet wide, in the centre of which has been left a single block
      of the stone, still of one piece with the court, which rises to a height
      of ten feet, and forms the basis or pedestal of the shrine itself.<a
      href="#linknote-64" name="linknoteref-64" id="linknoteref-64">64</a> The
      shrine is built of a certain number of large blocks, which have been
      quarried and brought to the spot; it has a stone roof with an entablature,
      and attains an elevation above the court of not less than twenty-seven
      feet. The dimensions of the shrine are small, not much exceeding seventeen
      feet each way.<a href="#linknote-65" name="linknoteref-65"
       id="linknoteref-65">65</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      From constructions of this mixed character the transition was easy to
      buildings composed entirely of detached stones put together in the
      ordinary manner. Here, what is chiefly remarkable in the Phoenician
      architecture is the tendency to employ, especially for the foundations and
      lower courses of buildings, enormous blocks. When the immovable native
      rock is no longer available, the resource is to make use of vast masses of
      stone, as nearly immovable as possible. The most noted example is that of
      the substructions which supported the platform whereon stood the Temple of
      Jerusalem, which was the work of the Phoenician builders whom Hiram lent
      to Solomon.<a href="#linknote-66" name="linknoteref-66" id="linknoteref-66">66</a>
      These substructions, laid bare at their base by the excavations of the
      Palestine Exploration Fund, are found to consist of blocks measuring from
      fifteen to twenty-five feet in length, and from ten to twelve feet in
      height. The width of the blocks at the angles of the wall, where alone it
      can be measured, is from twelve to eighteen feet. At the south-west angle
      no fewer than thirty-one courses of this massive character have been
      counted by the recent explorers, who estimate the weight of the largest
      block at something above a hundred tons!<a href="#linknote-67"
       name="linknoteref-67" id="linknoteref-67">67</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      A similar method of construction is found to have prevailed at Tyre, at
      Sidon, at Aradus, at Byblus, at Leptis Major, at Eryx, at Motya, at
      Gaulos, and at Lixus on the West African coast. The blocks employed do not
      reach the size of the largest discovered at Jerusalem, but still are of
      dimensions greatly exceeding those of most builders, varying, as they do,
      from six feet to twenty feet in length, and being often as much as seven
      or eight feet in breadth and height. As the building rises, the stones
      diminish in size, and the upper courses are often in no way remarkable.
      Stones of various sizes are used, and often the courses are not regular,
      but one runs into another. A tower in the wall of Eryx is a good specimen
      of this kind of construction.<a href="#linknote-68" name="linknoteref-68"
       id="linknoteref-68">68</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Where the stones are small, mortar has been employed by the builders, but
      where they are of a large size, they are merely laid side by side in rows
      or courses, without mortar or cement of any kind, and remain in place
      through their own mass and weight. In the earliest style of building the
      blocks are simply squared,<a href="#linknote-69" name="linknoteref-69"
       id="linknoteref-69">69</a> and the wall composed of them presents a flat
      and level surface, or one only broken by small and casual irregularities;
      but, when their ideas became more advanced, the Phoenicians preferred that
      style of masonry which is commonly regarded as peculiarly, if not
      exclusively, theirs<a href="#linknote-610" name="linknoteref-610"
       id="linknoteref-610">610</a>&mdash;the employment of large blocks with
      deeply bevelled edges. The bevel is a depression round the entire side of
      the stone, which faces outwards, and may be effected either by a sloping
      cut which removes the right-angle from the edge, or by two cuts, one
      perpendicular and the other horizontal, which take out from the edge a
      rectangular bar or plinth. The Phoenician bevelling is of this latter
      kind, and is generally accompanied by an artificial roughening of the
      surface inside the bevel, which offers a strong contrast to the smooth and
      even surface of the bevel itself.<a href="#linknote-611"
       name="linknoteref-611" id="linknoteref-611">611</a> The style is highly
      ornamental and effective, particularly where a large space of wall has to
      be presented to the eye, unbroken by door or window.<a href="#linknote-612"
       name="linknoteref-612" id="linknoteref-612">612</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally, but very rarely, and only (so far as appears) in their
      remoter dependencies, the Phoenicians constructed their buildings in the
      rude and irregular way, which has been called Cyclopian, employing unhewn
      polygonal blocks of various sizes, and fitting them roughly together. The
      temples discovered in Malta and Gozzo have masonry of this description.<a
      href="#linknote-613" name="linknoteref-613" id="linknoteref-613">613</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      A peculiarity in Phoenician architecture, connected with the preference
      for enormous blocks over stones of a moderate size, is the frequent
      combination in a single mass of distinct architectural members; for
      instance, of the shaft and capital of pillars, of entire pediments with a
      portion of the wall below them, and of the walls of monuments with the
      cornice and architrave. M. Renan has made some strong remarks on this
      idiosyncrasy. &ldquo;In the Grecian style,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;the beauty of the wall is
      a main object with the architect, and the wall derives its beauty from the
      divisions between the stones, which observe symmetrical laws, and are in
      agreement with the general lines of the edifice. In a style of this kind
      the stones of a wall have, all of them, the same dimension, and this
      dimension is determined by the general plan of the building; or else, as
      in the kind of work which is called &lsquo;pseud-isodomic,&rsquo; the very
      irregularity of the courses is governed by a law of symmetry. The stones
      of the architrave, the metopes, the triglyphs, are, all of them, separate
      blocks, even when it would have been perfectly easy to have included in a
      single block all these various members. Such facts, as one observes
      frequently in Syria, where three or four architectural members are brought
      out from a single block, would have appeared to the Greeks monstrous,
      since they are the negation of all logic."<a href="#linknote-614"
       name="linknoteref-614" id="linknoteref-614">614</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In cannot be denied that the habit of preferring large to small blocks,
      even in monuments of a very moderate size, involved the Phoenician
      architects in awkwardnesses and anomalies, which offend a cultivated
      taste; but it should be remembered, on the other hand, that massiveness in
      the material conduces greatly to stability, and that, in lands where
      earthquakes are frequent, as they are along all the Mediterranean shores,
      not many monuments would have survived the lapse of three thousand years
      had the material employed been of a less substantial and solid character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the Phoenician constructions, of which it is possible to give some
      account at the present day, without drawing greatly on the imagination,
      are their shrines, their temples, the walls of their towns, and, above
      all, their tombs. Recent researches in Phoenicia Proper, in Cyprus,
      Sicily, Africa, and the smaller Mediterranean islands, have brought to
      light numerous remains previously unknown; the few previously known
      remains have been carefully examined, measured, and in some cases
      photographed; and the results have been made accessible to the student in
      numerous well-illustrated publications. When Movers and Kenrick published
      their valuable works on the history of Phoenicia, and the general
      characteristics of the Phoenician people, it was quite impossible to do
      more than form conjectures concerning their architecture from a few coins,
      and a few descriptions in ancient writers. It is now a matter of
      comparatively little difficulty to set before the public descriptions and
      representations which, if they still leave something to be desired in the
      way of completeness, are accurate, so far as they go, and will give a
      tolerably fair idea of the architectural genius of the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      One very complete and two ruined shrines have been found in Phoenicia
      Proper, in positions and of a character which, in the judgment of the best
      antiquaries, mark them as the work of the ancient people. All these are
      situated on the mainland, near the site of Marathus, which lay nearly
      opposite the island of Ruad, the ancient Aradus. The shrine which is
      complete, or almost complete, bears the name of &ldquo;the Maabed&rdquo; or &ldquo;Temple.&rdquo;
       Its central position, in the middle of an excavated court, and its mixed
      construction, partly of native rock and partly of quarried stone, have
      been already described. It remains to give an account of the shrine or
      tabernacle itself.<a href="#linknote-615" name="linknoteref-615"
       id="linknoteref-615">615</a> This is emplaced upon the mass of rock left
      to receive it midway in the court, and is a sort of cell, closed in on
      three sides by walls, and open on one side, towards the north. The cell is
      formed of four quarried blocks, which are laid one over the other. These
      are nearly of the same size, and similarly shaped, each of them enclosing
      the cell on three sides, towards the east, the south, and the west. The
      fourth, which is larger than any of the others, constitutes the roof. It
      is a massive stone, carefully cut, which projects considerably in front of
      the rest of the building, and is ornamented towards the top with a cornice
      and string-course, extending along the four sides.<a href="#linknote-616"
       name="linknoteref-616" id="linknoteref-616">616</a> Internally the roof is
      scooped into a sort of shallow vault. The height of the shrine proper is
      about seventeen feet, and the elevation of the entire structure above the
      court in which it stands appears to be about twenty-seven feet. M. Renan
      conjectures that the projecting portion of the roof had originally the
      support of two pillars, which may have been either of wood, of stone, or
      of metal, and notes that there are two holes in the basement stone, into
      which the bottoms of the pillars were probably inserted.<a
      href="#linknote-617" name="linknoteref-617" id="linknoteref-617">617</a>
      He imagines that the court was once enclosed completely by the
      construction of a wall at its northern end, and that the water from a
      spring, which still rises within the enclosure, was allowed to overflow
      the entire space, so that the shrine looked down upon a basin or shallow
      lake and glassed itself in the waters.<a href="#linknote-618"
       name="linknoteref-618" id="linknoteref-618">618</a> An image of a deity
      may have stood in the cell under the roof, dimly visible to the worshipper
      between the two porch pillars.

      The two ruined tabernacles lie at no great distance from the complete one,
      which has just been described. One of them is so injured that its plan is
      irrecoverable; but M. Renan carefully collected and measured the fragments
      of the other, and thus obtained sufficient data for its restoration.<a
      href="#linknote-619" name="linknoteref-619" id="linknoteref-619">619</a>
      It was, he believes, a monolithic chamber, with a roof slightly vaulted,
      like that of the <i>Maabed</i>, having a length of eight feet, a breadth
      of five, and a height of about ten feet, and ornamented externally with a
      very peculiar cornice. This consisted of a series of carvings,
      representing the fore part of an uræus or basilisk serpent, uprearing
      itself against the wall of the shrine, which were continued along the
      entire front of the chamber. There was also an internal ornamentation of
      the roof, consisting of a winged circle of an Egyptian character&mdash;a
      favourite subject with the Phoenician artists<a href="#linknote-620"
       name="linknoteref-620" id="linknoteref-620">620</a>&mdash;the circle
      having an uræus erect on either side of it, and also of another winged
      figure which appeared to represent an eagle.<a href="#linknote-621"
       name="linknoteref-621" id="linknoteref-621">621</a> The monolithic chamber
      was emplaced upon a block of stone, ten feet in length and breadth, and
      six feet in height, which itself stood upon a much smaller stone, and
      overhung it on all sides. A flight of six steps, cut in the upper block at
      either side, gave access to the chamber, which, however, as it stood in a
      pool of water, must have been approached by a boat. The entire height of
      the shrine above the water must have been about eighteen feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some other ruined shrines have been found in the more distant of the
      Phoenician settlements, and representations of them are common upon the <i>stelæ</i>,
      set up in temples as votive offerings. On these last the uræus cornice is
      frequently repeated, and the figure of a goddess sometimes appears,
      standing between the pillars which support the front of the shrine.<a
      href="#linknote-622" name="linknoteref-622" id="linknoteref-622">622</a>
      There is a decided resemblance between the Phoenician shrines and the
      small Egyptian temples, which have been called <i>mammeisi</i>, the chief
      difference being that the latter are for the most part peristylar.<a
      href="#linknote-623" name="linknoteref-623" id="linknoteref-623">623</a>
      M. Renan says of the <i>Maabed</i>, or main shrine at Amrith:&mdash;&ldquo;L&rsquo;aspect
      général de l&rsquo;édifice est Egyptian, mais avec une certaine part
      d&rsquo;originalité. Le bandeau et la corniche sur les quatre côtés de la stalle
      supériere en sont le seul ornement. Cette simplicité, cette sévérité de
      style, jointes à l&rsquo;idée de force et de puissance qu&rsquo;éveillent les
      dimensions énormes des matériaux employés, sont des caractères que nous
      avons déjà signalés dans les monumens funéraires d&rsquo;Amrith."<a

      From the shrines of the Phoenicians we may now pass to their temples, of
      which, however, the remains are, unfortunately, exceedingly scanty. Of
      real temples, as distinct from shrines, Phoenicia Proper does not present
      to us so much as a single specimen. To obtain any idea of them, we must
      quit the mother country, and betake ourselves to the colonies, especially
      to those island colonies which have been less subjected than the mainland
      to the destructive ravages of barbarous conquerors, and the iconoclasm of
      fanatical populations. It is especially in Cyprus that we meet with
      extensive remains, which, if not so instructive as might have been wished,
      yet give us some important and interesting information.
    </p>
    <p>
      The temple of Paphos, according to the measurements of General Di Cesnola,<a
      href="#linknote-625" name="linknoteref-625" id="linknoteref-625">625</a>
      was a rectangular building, 221 feet long by 167 feet wide, built along
      its lower corners of large blocks of stone, but probably continued above
      in an inferior material, either wood or unbaked brick.<a
      href="#linknote-626" name="linknoteref-626" id="linknoteref-626">626</a>
      The four corner-stones are still standing in their proper places, and give
      the dimensions without a possibility of mistake. Nothing is known of the
      internal arrangements, unless we attach credit to the views of the savant
      Gerhard, who, in the early years of the present century, constructed a
      plan from the reports of travellers, in which he divided the building into
      a nave and two aisles, with an ante-chapel in front, and a sacrarium at
      the further extremity.<a href="#linknote-627" name="linknoteref-627"
       id="linknoteref-627">627</a> M. Gerhard also added, beyond the sacrarium,
      an apse, of which General Di Cesnola found no traces, but which may
      possibly have disappeared in the course of the sixty years which separated
      the observations of M. Gerhard&rsquo;s informants from the researches of the
      later traveller. The arrangement into a nave and two aisles is, to a
      certain extent, confirmed by some of the later Cyprian coins, which
      certainly represent Cyprian temples, and probably the temple of Paphos.<a
      href="#linknote-628" name="linknoteref-628" id="linknoteref-628">628</a>
      The floor of the temple was, in part at any rate, covered with mosaic.<a
      href="#linknote-629" name="linknoteref-629" id="linknoteref-629">629</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This large building, which extended over an area of 36,800 square feet,
      was emplaced within a sacred court, surrounded by a <i>peribolus</i>, or
      wall of enclosure, built of even larger blocks than the temple itself, and
      entered by at least one huge doorway. The width of this entrance, situated
      near a corner of the western wall, was nearly eighteen feet.<a
      href="#linknote-630" name="linknoteref-630" id="linknoteref-630">630</a>
      On one side of it were found still fixed in the wall the sockets for the
      bolts on which the door swung, in length six inches, and of proportionate
      width and depth. The peribolus was rectangular, like the temple, and was
      built in lines parallel to it. The longer sides measured 690 and the
      shorter 530 feet. One block, which was of blue granite and must have come
      either from Asia Minor or from Egypt, measured fifteen feet ten inches in
      length, with a width of seven feet eleven inches, and a depth of two feet
      five inches.<a href="#linknote-631" name="linknoteref-631"
       id="linknoteref-631">631</a> It is thought that the court was probably
      surrounded by a colonnade or cloister,<a href="#linknote-632"
       name="linknoteref-632" id="linknoteref-632">632</a> though no traces have
      been at present observed either of the pillars which must have supported
      such a cloister or of the rafters which must have formed its roof. Ponds,<a
      href="#linknote-633" name="linknoteref-633" id="linknoteref-633">633</a>
      fountains, shrubberies, gardens, groves of trees, probably covered the
      open space between the cloister and the temple, while well-shaded walks
      led across it from the gates of the enclosure to those of the sanctuary.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we allow ourselves to indulge our fancy for a brief space, and to
      complete the temple according to the idea which the coins above
      represented naturally suggest, we may suppose that it did, in fact,
      consist of a nave, two aisles, and a cell, or &ldquo;holy of holies,&rdquo; the nave
      being of superior height to the aisles, and rising in front into a
      handsome façade, like the western end of a cathedral flanked by towers.
      Through the open doorway between the towers might be seen dimly the sacred
      cone or pillar which was emblematic of deity; on either side the eye
      caught the ends of the aisles, not more than half the height of the
      towers, and each crowned with a strongly projecting cornice, perhaps
      ornamented with a row of uræi. In front of the two aisles, standing by
      themselves, were twin columns, like Jachin and Boaz before the Temple of
      Solomon. The aisles were certainly roofed: whether the nave also was
      covered in, or whether, like the Greek hypæthral temples, it lay open to
      the blue vault of heaven, is perhaps doubtful. The walls of the buildings,
      after a few courses of hewn stone, were probably of wood, perhaps of
      cedar, enriched with the precious metals, and the pavement was adorned
      with a mosaic of many colours, &ldquo;white, yellow, red, brown, and rose."<a
      href="#linknote-634" name="linknoteref-634" id="linknoteref-634">634</a>
      Outside the temple was a mass of verdure. &ldquo;In the sacred precinct, and in
      its dependencies, all breathed of voluptuousness, all spoke to the senses.
      The air of the place was full of perfumes, full of soft and caressing
      sounds. There was the murmur of rills which flowed over a carpet of
      flowers; there was, in the foliage above, the song of the nightingale, and
      the prolonged and tender cooing of the dove; there were, in the groves
      around, the tones of the flute, the instrument which sounds the call to
      pleasure, and summons to the banquet chamber the festive procession and
      the bridal train. Beneath the shelter of tents, or of light booths with
      walls formed by the skilful interlacing of a green mass of boughs, through
      which the myrtle and the laurel spread their odours, dwelt the fair slaves
      of the goddess, those whom Pindar called, in the drinking-song which he
      composed for Theoxenus of Corinth, &lsquo;the handmaids of persuasion.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a
      href="#linknote-635" name="linknoteref-635" id="linknoteref-635">635</a>
      Here and there in the precincts, sacred processions took their prescribed
      way; ablutions were performed; victims led up to the temple; votive
      offerings hung on the trees; festal dances, it may be, performed; while in
      the cloister which skirted the peribolus, dealers in shrines and images
      chaffered with their customers, erotic poets sang their lays, lovers
      whispered, fortune-tellers plied their trade, and a throng of pilgrims
      walked lazily along, or sat on the ground, breathing in the soft, moist
      air, feasting their eyes upon the beauty of upspringing fountain and
      flowering shrub, and lofty tree, while their ears drank in the cadences of
      the falling waters, the song of the birds, and the gay music which floated
      lightly on the summer breeze.

      Phoenician temples had sometimes adjuncts, as cathedrals have their
      chapter-houses and muniment rooms, which were at once interesting and
      important. There has been discovered at Athiénau in Cyprus&mdash;the
      supposed site of Golgi&mdash;a ruined edifice, which some have taken for a
      temple,<a href="#linknote-636" name="linknoteref-636" id="linknoteref-636">636</a>
      but which appears to have been rather a repository for votive offerings, a
      sort of ecclesiastical museum. A picture of the edifice, as he conceives
      it to have stood in its original condition, has been drawn by one of its
      earliest visitants. &ldquo;The building,&rdquo; he says,<a href="#linknote-637"
       name="linknoteref-637" id="linknoteref-637">637</a> &ldquo;was constructed of
      sun-dried bricks, forming four walls, the base of which rested upon a
      substruction of solid stone-work. The walls were covered, as are the
      houses of the Cypriot peasants of to-day, with a stucco which was either
      white or coloured, and which was impenetrable by rain. Wooden pillars with
      stone capitals supported internally a pointed roof, which sloped at a low
      angle. It formed thus a sort of terrace, like the roofs that we see in
      Cyprus at the present day. This roof was composed of a number of wooden
      rafters placed very near each other, above which was spread a layer of
      rushes and coarse mats, covered with a thick bed of earth well pressed
      together, equally effective against the entrance of moisture and against
      the sun&rsquo;s rays. Externally the building must have presented a very simple
      appearance. In the interior, which received no light except from the wide
      doorways in the walls, an immovable and silent crowd of figures in stone,
      with features and garments made more striking by the employment of paint,
      surrounded, as with a perpetual worship, the mystic cone. Stone lamps,
      shaped like diminutive temples, illumined in the corners the grinning <i>ex-votos</i>
      which hung upon the walls, and the curious pictures with which they were
      accompanied. Grotesque bas-reliefs adorned the circuit of the edifice,
      where the slanting light was reflected from the white and polished
      pavement-stones."<a href="#linknote-638" name="linknoteref-638"
       id="linknoteref-638">638</a> In length and breadth the chamber measured
      sixty feet by thirty; the thickness of the basement wall was three feet.<a
      href="#linknote-639" name="linknoteref-639" id="linknoteref-639">639</a>
      Midway between the side walls stood three rows of large square pedestals&mdash;regularly
      spaced, and dividing the interior into four vistas or avenues, which some
      critics regard as bases for statues, and some as supports for the pillars
      which sustained the roof.<a href="#linknote-640" name="linknoteref-640"
       id="linknoteref-640">640</a> Two stone capitals of pillars were found
      within the area of the chamber; and it is conjectured that the entire
      disappearance of the shafts may be accounted for by their having been of
      wood,<a href="#linknote-641" name="linknoteref-641" id="linknoteref-641">641</a>
      the employment of wooden shafts with stone bases and capitals being common
      in Cyprus at the present time.<a href="#linknote-642"
       name="linknoteref-642" id="linknoteref-642">642</a> Against each of the
      four walls was a row of pedestals touching each other, which had certainly
      been bases for statues, since the statues were found lying, mostly broken,
      in front of them. The figures varied greatly in size, some being colossal,
      others mere statuettes. Most probably all were votive offerings, presented
      by those who imagined that they had been helped by the god of the temple
      to which the chamber belonged, as an indication of their gratitude. The
      number of pedestals found along one of the walls was seventy-two,<a
      href="#linknote-643" name="linknoteref-643" id="linknoteref-643">643</a>
      and the original number must have been at least three times as great.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another Cyprian temple, situated at Curium, not far from Paphos, contained
      a very remarkable crypt, which appears to have been used as a
      treasure-house.<a href="#linknote-644" name="linknoteref-644"
       id="linknoteref-644">644</a> It was entered by means of a flight of steps
      which conducted to a low and narrow passage cut in the rock, and giving
      access to a set of three similar semi-circular chambers, excavated side by
      side, and separated one from another by doors. Beyond the third of these,
      and at right angles to it, was a fourth somewhat smaller chamber, which
      gave upon a second passage that it was found impossible to explore.<a
      href="#linknote-645" name="linknoteref-645" id="linknoteref-645">645</a>
      The three principal chambers were fourteen feet six inches in height,
      twenty-three feet long, and twenty-one feet broad. The fourth was a little
      smaller,<a href="#linknote-646" name="linknoteref-646" id="linknoteref-646">646</a>
      and shaped somewhat irregularly. All contained plate and jewels of
      extraordinary richness, and often of rare workmanship. &ldquo;The treasure
      found,&rdquo; says M. Perrot, &ldquo;surpassed all expectation, and even all hope.
      Never had such a discovery been made of such a collection of precious
      articles, where the material was of the richest, and the specimens of
      different styles most curious. There were many bracelets of massive gold,
      and among them two which weighed a pound apiece, and several others of a
      weight not much short of this. Gold was met with in profusion under all
      manner of forms&mdash;finger-rings, ear-rings, amulets, flasks, small
      bottles, hair-pins, heavy necklaces. Silver was found in even greater
      abundance, both in ornaments and in vessels; besides which there were
      articles in electrum, which is an amalgam of silver with gold. Among the
      stones met with were rock-crystals, carnelians, onyxes, agates, and other
      hard stones of every variety; and further there were paste jewels,
      cylinders in soft stone, statuettes in burnt clay, earthen vases, and also
      many objects in bronze, as lamps, tripods, candelabra, chairs, vases,
      arms, &amp;c. &amp;c. A certain amount of order reigned in the repository.
      The precious objects in gold were collected together principally in the
      first chamber. The second contained the silver vessels, which were
      arranged along a sort of shelf cut in the rock, at the height of about
      eight inches above the floor. Unfortunately the oxydation of these vessels
      had proceeded to such lengths, that only a very small number could be
      extracted from the mass, which for the most part crumbled into dust at the
      touch of a finger. The third chamber held lamps and fibulæ in bronze,
      vases in alabaster, and, above all, the groups and vessels modelled in
      clay; while the fourth was the repository of the utensils in bronze, and
      of a certain number which were either in copper or in iron. In the further
      passage, which was not completely explored, there were nevertheless found
      seven kettles in bronze."<a href="#linknote-647" name="linknoteref-647"
       id="linknoteref-647">647</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the construction of the walls of their towns, especially of those which
      were the most ancient, the feature which is most striking at first sight
      is that on which some remarks have already been made, the attachment of
      the lower portion of the wall to the soil from which the wall springs. At
      Sidon, at Aradus, and at Semar-Gebeil, the <i>enceinte</i> which protected
      the town consisted, up to the height of ten or twelve feet, of native
      rock, cut to a perpendicular face, upon which were emplaced several
      courses of hewn stone. The principle adopted was to utilise the rock as
      far as possible, and then to supplement what was wanting by a
      superstructure of masonry. Large blocks of stone, shaped to fit the upper
      surface of the rock, were laid upon it, generally endways, that is, with
      their smallest surface outwards, their length forming the thickness of the
      wall, which was sometimes as much as fifteen or twenty feet.<a
      href="#linknote-648" name="linknoteref-648" id="linknoteref-648">648</a>
      The massive blocks, once placed, were almost immovable, and it was
      considered enough to lay them side by side, without clamps or mortar,
      since their own weight kept them in place. It was not thought of much
      consequence whether the joints of the courses coincided or not; though
      care was taken that, if a coincidence occurred in two courses, it should
      not be repeated in the third.<a href="#linknote-649" name="linknoteref-649"
       id="linknoteref-649">649</a> The elevation of walls does not seem to have
      often exceeded from thirty to forty feet, though Diodorus makes the walls
      of Carthage sixty feet high,<a href="#linknote-650" name="linknoteref-650"
       id="linknoteref-650">650</a> and Arrian gives to the wall of Tyre which
      faced the continent the extraordinary height of a hundred and fifty feet.<a
      href="#linknote-651" name="linknoteref-651" id="linknoteref-651">651</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      If we may generalise from the most perfect specimens of Phoenician
      town-walls that are still fairly traceable, as those of Eryx and Lixus,<a
      href="#linknote-652" name="linknoteref-652" id="linknoteref-652">652</a>
      we may lay it down, that such walls were usually flanked, at irregular
      intervals, by square or rectangular towers, which projected considerably
      beyond the line of the curtain. The towers were of a more massive
      construction than the wall itself, especially in the lower portion, where
      vast blocks were common. The wall was also broken at intervals by gates,
      some of which were posterns, either arched or covered in by flat stones,<a
      href="#linknote-653" name="linknoteref-653" id="linknoteref-653">653</a>
      while others were of larger dimensions, and were protected, on one side or
      on both, by bastions. The sites of towns were commonly eminences, and the
      line of the walls followed the irregularities of the ground, crowning the
      slopes where they were steepest. Sometimes, as at Carthage and Thapsus,
      where the wall had to be carried across a flat space, the wall of defence
      was doubled, or even tripled. The restorations of Daux<a
      href="#linknote-654" name="linknoteref-654" id="linknoteref-654">654</a>
      contain, no doubt, a good deal that is fanciful; but they give, probably,
      a fair idea of the general character of the so-called &ldquo;triple wall&rdquo; of
      certain Phoenician cities. The outer line, or {proteikhisma}, was little
      more than an earthwork, consisting of a ditch, with the earth from it
      thrown up inwards, crowned perhaps at top with a breastwork of masonry.
      The second line was far more elaborate. There was first a ditch deeper
      than the outer one, while behind this rose a perpendicular battlemented
      wall to the height, from the bottom of the ditch, of nearly forty feet. In
      the thickness of the wall, which was not much less than the height, were
      chambers for magazines and cisterns, while along the top, behind the
      parapet, ran a platform, from which the defenders discharged their arrows
      and other missiles against the enemy. Further back, at the distance of
      about thirty yards, came the main line of defence, which in general
      character resembled the second, but was loftier and stronger. There was,
      first, a third ditch (or moat, if water could be introduced), and behind
      it a wall thirty-five feet thick and sixty feet high, pierced by two rows
      of embrasures from which arrows could be discharged, and having a triple
      platform for the defenders. This wall was kept entirely clear of the
      houses of the town, and the different storeys could be reached by sloping
      ascents or internal staircases. It was flanked at intervals by square
      towers, somewhat higher than the walls, which projected sufficiently for
      the defenders to enfilade the assailants when they approached the base of
      the curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tombs of the Phoenicians were, most usually, underground
      constructions, either simple excavations in the rock, or subterranean
      chambers, built of hewn stone, at the bottom of sloping passages, or
      perpendicular shafts, which gave access to them. The simpler kinds bear a
      close resemblance to the sepulchres of the Jews. A chamber is opened in
      the rock, in the sides of which are hollowed out, horizontally, a number
      of caverns or <i>loculi</i>, each one intended to receive a corpse.<a
      href="#linknote-655" name="linknoteref-655" id="linknoteref-655">655</a>
      If more space is needed, a passage is made from one of the sides of the
      chamber to a certain distance, and then a second chamber is excavated, and
      more <i>loculi</i> are formed; and the process is repeated as often as
      necessary. But chambers thus excavated were apt to collapse, especially if
      the rock was of the soft and friable nature so common in Phoenicia Proper
      and in Cyprus; on which account, in such soils, the second kind of tomb
      was preferred, sepulchural chambers being solidly built,<a
      href="#linknote-656" name="linknoteref-656" id="linknoteref-656">656</a>
      either singly or in groups, each made to hold a certain number of
      sarcophagi. The most remarkable tombs of this class are those found at
      Amathus, on the south coast of Cyprus, by General Di Cesnola. They lie at
      the depth of from forty to fifty-five feet below the surface of the soil,<a
      href="#linknote-657" name="linknoteref-657" id="linknoteref-657">657</a>
      and are square chambers, built of huge stones, carefully squared, some of
      them twenty feet in length, nine in breadth, and three in thickness, and
      even averaging a length of fourteen feet.<a href="#linknote-658"
       name="linknoteref-658" id="linknoteref-658">658</a> Two shapes occur. Some
      of the tombs are almost perfect cubes, the upright walls rising to a
      height of twelve or fifteen feet, and being then covered in by three or
      four long slabs of stone. Others resemble huts, having a gable at either
      end, and a sloping roof formed of slabs which meet and support each other.
      A squared doorway, from five to six feet in height, gives entrance to the
      tombs at one end, and has for ornament a fourfold fillet, which surrounds
      it on three sides. Otherwise, ornamentation is absent, the stonework of
      both walls and roofs being absolutely plain and bare. Internally the
      chambers present the same naked appearance, walls and roofs being equally
      plain, and the floor paved with oblong slabs of stone, about a foot and a
      half in length.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grouped chambers are of several kinds. Sometimes there are two
      chambers only, one opening directly into the other, and not always
      similarly roofed. Occasionally, groups of three are found, and there are
      examples of groups of four. In these instances, the exact symmetry is
      remarkable. A single doorway of the usual character gives entrance to a
      nearly square chamber, the exact dimensions of which are thirteen feet
      four inches by twelve feet two inches. Midway in the side and opposite
      walls are three other doorways, each of them three foot six inches in
      width, which lead into exactly similar square chambers, having a length of
      twelve feet two inches, and a width of ten feet nine.<a
      href="#linknote-659" name="linknoteref-659" id="linknoteref-659">659</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Chambers of the character here described contain in almost every instance
      stone sarcophagi. These are ranged along the walls, at a little distance
      from them. The chambers commonly contain two or three; but sometimes one
      sarcophagus is superimposed upon another, and in this way the number
      occasionally reaches to six.<a href="#linknote-660" name="linknoteref-660"
       id="linknoteref-660">660</a> Mostly, the sarcophagi are plain, or nearly
      so, but are covered over with a sloping lid. Sometimes, however, they are
      elaborately carved, and constitute works of art, which are of the highest
      value. An account will be given of the most remarkable of these objects in
      the chapter on Phoenician Æsthetic Art.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another distinct type of Phoenician tomb is that which is peculiar to
      Nea-Paphos, and which is thought by some to have been employed exclusively
      by the High Priests of the great temple there.<a href="#linknote-661"
       name="linknoteref-661" id="linknoteref-661">661</a> The peculiarity of
      these burial-places is, that the sepulchral chambers are adjuncts of a
      quadrangular court open to the sky, and surrounded by a colonnade
      supported on pillars.<a href="#linknote-662" name="linknoteref-662"
       id="linknoteref-662">662</a> The court, the colonnade, the pillars, the
      entablature, and the chambers, with their niches for the dead, are all
      equally cut out of the rock, as well as the passage by which the court is
      entered, at one corner of the quadrangle. The columns are either square or
      rounded, the rounded ones having capitals resembling those of the Doric
      order; and the entablature is also a rough imitation of the Doric
      triglyphs, and guttæ. The entrances to the sepulchral chambers are under
      the colonnade, behind the pillars;<a href="#linknote-663"
       name="linknoteref-663" id="linknoteref-663">663</a> and the chambers
      contain, beside niches, a certain number of bases for sarcophagi, but no
      sarcophagi have been found in them. The quadrangle is of a small size, not
      more than about eighteen feet each way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far we have described that portion of the sepulchral architecture of
      the Phoenicians which is most hidden from sight, lying, as it does,
      beneath the surface of the soil. With tombs of this quiet character the
      Phoenicians were ordinarily contented. They were not, however, wholly
      devoid of those feelings with respect to their dead which have caused the
      erection, in most parts of the world, of sepulchral monuments intended to
      attract the eye, and to hand on to later ages the memory of the departed.
      Well acquainted with Egypt, they could not but have been aware from the
      earliest times of those massive piles which the vanity of Egyptian
      monarchs had raised up for their own glorification on the western side of
      the valley of the Nile; nor in later days could such monuments have
      escaped their notice as the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus<a
      href="#linknote-664" name="linknoteref-664" id="linknoteref-664">664</a>
      or the Tomb of the Maccabees.<a href="#linknote-665" name="linknoteref-665"
       id="linknoteref-665">665</a> Accordingly, we find them, at a very remote
      period, not merely anxious to inter their dead decently and carefully in
      rock tombs or subterranean chambers of massive stone, but also wishful
      upon occasions to attract attention to the last resting-places of their
      great men, by constructions which showed themselves above the ground, and
      had some architectural pretensions. One of these, situated near Amrith,
      the ancient Marathus, is a very curious and peculiar structure. It is
      known at the present day as the Burdj-el-Bezzâk,<a href="#linknote-666"
       name="linknoteref-666" id="linknoteref-666">666</a> and was evidently
      constructed to be, like the pyramids, at once a monument and a tomb. It is
      an edifice, built of large blocks of stone, and rising to a height of
      thirty-two feet above the plain at its base, so contrived as to contain
      two sepulchral chambers, the one over the other. Externally, the monument
      is plain almost to rudeness, being little more than a cubic mass, broken
      only by two doorways, and having for its sole ornament a projecting
      cornice in front. Internally, there is more art and contrivance. The
      chambers are very carefully constructed, and contain a number of niches
      intended to receive sarcophagi, the lower having accommodation for three
      and the upper for twelve bodies.<a href="#linknote-667"
       name="linknoteref-667" id="linknoteref-667">667</a> It is thought that
      originally the cubic mass, which is all that now remains, was surmounted
      by a pyramidical roof, many stones from which were found by M. Renan among
      the débris that were scattered around. The height of the monument was thus
      increased by perhaps one-half, and did not fall much short of sixty-five
      feet.<a href="#linknote-668" name="linknoteref-668" id="linknoteref-668">668</a>
      The cornice, which is now seen on one side only, and which is there
      imperfect, originally, no doubt, encircled the entire edifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other constructions erected by the Phoenicians to mark the
      resting-places of their dead are simple monuments erected near, and
      generally over, the tombs in which the bodies are interred. The best known
      is probably that in the vicinity of Tyre, which the natives call the
      Kabr-Hiram, or &ldquo;Tomb of Hiram."<a href="#linknote-669"
       name="linknoteref-669" id="linknoteref-669">669</a> No great importance
      can be attached to this name, which appears to be a purely modern one;<a
      href="#linknote-670" name="linknoteref-670" id="linknoteref-670">670</a>
      but the monument is undoubtedly ancient, perhaps as ancient as any other
      in Phoenicia.<a href="#linknote-671" name="linknoteref-671"
       id="linknoteref-671">671</a> It is composed of eight courses of huge
      stones superimposed one upon another,<a href="#linknote-672"
       name="linknoteref-672" id="linknoteref-672">672</a> the blocks having in
      some cases a length of eleven or twelve feet, with a breadth of seven or
      eight, and a depth of three feet. The courses retreat slightly, with the
      exception of the fifth, which projects considerably beyond the line of the
      fourth and still more beyond that of the sixth. The whole effect is less
      that of a pyramid than of a stelé or pillar, the width at top being not
      very much smaller than that at the base. The monument is a solid mass, and
      is not a square but a rectangular oblong, the broader sides measuring
      fourteen feet and the narrower about eight feet six inches. Two out of the
      eight courses are of the nature of substructions, being supplemental to
      the rock, which supplies their place in part; and it is only recently that
      they have been brought to light by means of excavation. Hence the earlier
      travellers speak of the monument as having no more than six courses. The
      present height above the soil is a little short of twenty-five feet. A
      flight of steps cut in the rock leads down from the monument to a
      sepulchral chamber, which, however, contains neither sepulchral niche nor
      sarcophagus.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the most striking of the Phoenician sepulchral monuments are to be
      found in the north of Phoenicia, and not in the south, in the
      neighbourhood, not of Tyre and Sidon, but of Marathus and Aradus. Two of
      them, known as the Méghâzil,<a href="#linknote-673" name="linknoteref-673"
       id="linknoteref-673">673</a> form a group which is very remarkable, and
      which, if we may trust the restoration of M. Thobois,<a
      href="#linknote-674" name="linknoteref-674" id="linknoteref-674">674</a>
      must have had considerable architectural merit. Situated very near each
      other, on the culminating point of a great plateau of rock, they dominate
      the country far and wide, and attract the eye from a long distance. One
      seems to have been in much simpler and better taste than the other. M.
      Renan calls it &ldquo;a real masterpiece, in respect of proportion, of elegance,
      and of majesty."<a href="#linknote-675" name="linknoteref-675"
       id="linknoteref-675">675</a> It is built altogether in three stages.
      First, there is a circular basement story flanked by four figures of
      lions, attached to the wall behind them, and only showing in front of it
      their heads, their shoulders, and their fore paws. This basement, which
      has a height of between seven and eight feet, is surmounted by a
      cylindrical tower in two stages, the lower stage measuring fourteen and
      the upper, which is domed, ten feet. The basement is composed of four
      great stones, the entire tower above it is one huge monolith. An unusual
      and very effective ornamentation crowns both stages of the tower,
      consisting of a series of gradines at top with square machicolations
      below.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other monument of the pair, distant about twenty feet from the one
      already described, is architecturally far less happy. It is composed of
      four members, viz. a low plinth for base, above this a rectangular
      pedestal, surmounted by a strong band or cornice; next, a monolithic
      cylinder, without ornaments, which contracts slightly as it ascends; and,
      lastly, a pentagonal pyramid at the top. The pedestal is exceedingly rough
      and unfinished; generally, the workmanship is rude, and the different
      members do not assort well one with another. Still it would seem that the
      two monuments belong to the same age and are parts of the same plan.<a
      href="#linknote-676" name="linknoteref-676" id="linknoteref-676">676</a>
      Their lines are parallel, as are those of the subterranean apartments
      which they cover, and they stand within a single enclosure. Whether the
      same architect designed them both it is impossible to determine, but if so
      he must have been one of the class of artists who have sometimes happy and
      sometimes unhappy inspirations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the Méghâzil are superimposed upon subterranean chambers, containing
      niches for bodies, and reached by a flight of steps cut in the rock, the
      entrance to which is at some little distance from the monuments.<a
      href="#linknote-677" name="linknoteref-677" id="linknoteref-677">677</a>
      But there is nothing at all striking or peculiar in the chambers, which
      are without ornament of any kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another tomb, in the vicinity of the Méghâzil, is remarkable chiefly for
      the care taken to shelter and protect the entrance to the set of chambers
      which it covers.<a href="#linknote-678" name="linknoteref-678"
       id="linknoteref-678">678</a> The monument is a simple one. A square
      monolith, crowned by a strong cornice, stands upon a base consisting of
      two steps. Above the cornice is another monolith, the lower part squared
      and the upper shaped into a pyramid. The upper part of the pyramid has
      crumbled away, but enough remains to show the angle of the slope, and to
      indicate for the original erection a height of about twenty feet. At the
      distance of about ten yards from the base of the monument is a second
      erection, consisting of two tiers of large stones, which roof in the
      entrance to a flight of eighteen steps. These steps lead downwards to a
      sloping passage, in which are sepulchral niches, and thence into two
      chambers, the inner one of which is almost directly under the main
      monument. Probably, a block of stone, movable but removed with difficulty,
      originally closed the entrance at the point where the steps begin. This
      stone ordinarily prevented ingress, but when a fresh corpse was to be
      admitted, or funeral ceremonies were to be performed in one of the
      chambers, it could be &ldquo;rolled"<a href="#linknote-679"
       name="linknoteref-679" id="linknoteref-679">679</a> or dragged away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phoenician architects were, as a general rule, exceedingly sparing in the
      use of ornament. Neither the pillar, nor the arch, much less the vault,
      was a feature in their principal buildings, which affected straight lines,
      right-angles, and a massive construction, based upon the Egyptian. The
      pillar came ultimately to be adopted, to a certain extent, from the
      Greeks; but only the simplest forms, the Doric and Ionic, were in use, if
      we except certain barbarous types which the people invented for
      themselves. The true arch was scarcely known in Phoenicia, at any rate
      till Roman times, though false arches were not infrequent in the gateways
      of towns and the doors of houses.<a href="#linknote-680"
       name="linknoteref-680" id="linknoteref-680">680</a> The external
      ornamentation of buildings was chiefly by cornices of various kinds, by
      basement mouldings, by carvings about doorways,<a href="#linknote-681"
       name="linknoteref-681" id="linknoteref-681">681</a> by hemispherical or
      pyramidical roofs, and by the use of bevelled stones in the walls. The
      employment of animal forms in external decoration was exceedingly rare;
      and the half lions of the circular Méghâzil of Amrith are almost unique.
    </p>
    <p>
      In internal ornamentation there was greater variety. Pavements were
      sometimes of mosaic, and glowed with various colours;<a
      href="#linknote-682" name="linknoteref-682" id="linknoteref-682">682</a>
      sometimes they were of alabaster slabs elaborately patterned. Alabaster
      slabs also, it is probable, adorned the walls of temples and houses,
      excepting where woodwork was employed, as in the Temple of Solomon. There
      is much richness and beauty in many of the slabs now in the Phoenician
      collection of the Louvre,<a href="#linknote-683" name="linknoteref-683"
       id="linknoteref-683">683</a> especially in those which exhibit the forms
      of sphinxes or griffins. Many of the patterns most affected are markedly
      Assyrian in character, as the rosette, the palm-head, the intertwined
      ribbons, and the rows of gradines which occur so frequently. Even the
      Sphinxes are rather Assyrian than Egyptian in character; and exhibit the
      recurved wings, which are never found in the valley of the Nile. In almost
      all the forms employed there is a modification of the original type,
      sufficient to show that the Phoenician artist did not care merely to
      reproduce.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the whole the architecture must be pronounced wanting in originality
      and in a refined taste. What M. Renan says of Phoenician art in general<a
      href="#linknote-684" name="linknoteref-684" id="linknoteref-684">684</a>
      is especially true of Phoenician architecture. &ldquo;Phoenician art, which
      issued, as it would seem, originally from mere troglodytism, was, from the
      time when it arrived at the need of ornament, essentially an art of
      imitation. That art was, above all, industrial; that art never raised
      itself for its great public monuments to a style that was at once elegant
      and durable. The origin of Phoenician architecture was the excavated rock,
      not the column, as was the case with the Greeks. The wall replaced the
      excavated rock after a time, but without wholly losing its character.
      There is nothing that leads us to believe that the Phoenicians knew how to
      construct a keyed vault. The monolithic principle which dominated the
      Phoenician and Syrian art, even after it had taken Greek art for its
      model, is the exact contrary of the Hellenic style. Greek architecture
      starts from the principle of employing small stones, and proclaims the
      principal loudly. At no time did the Greeks extract from Pentelicus blocks
      at all comparable for size with those of Baalbek or of Egypt; they saw no
      use in doing so; on the contrary, with masses of such enormity, which it
      is desired to use in their entirety, the architect is himself dominated;
      the material, instead of being subordinate to the design of the edifice,
      runs counter to the design and contradicts it. The monuments on the
      Acropolis of Athens would be impossible with blocks of the size usual in
      Syria."<a href="#linknote-685" name="linknoteref-685" id="linknoteref-685">685</a>
      Thus there is always something heavy, rude, and coarse in the Phoenician
      buildings, which betray their troglodyte origin by an over-massive and
      unfinished appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also a want of originality, more especially in the ornamentation.
      Egypt, Assyria, and Greece have furnished the &ldquo;motives&rdquo; which lie at the
      root of almost all the decorative art that is to be met with, either in
      the mother country or in the colonies. Winged disks, uræi, scarabs,
      sphinxes, have been adopted from Egypt; Assyria has furnished gradines,
      lotus blossoms, rosettes, the palm-tree ornament, the ribbon ornament, and
      the form of the lion; Greece has supplied pillars, pediments, festoons,
      and chimæras. Native talent has contributed little or nothing to the
      ornamentation of buildings, if we except the modification of the types
      which have been derived from foreign sources.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, there is a want of combination and general plan in the Phoenician
      constructions where they fall into groups. &ldquo;This is sensibly felt,&rdquo;
       according to M. Renan, &ldquo;at Amrith, at Kabr-Hiram, and at Um-el-Awamid. In
      the remains still visible in these localities there are many fine ideas,
      many beautiful details; but they do not fall under any general dominant
      plan, as do the buildings on the Acropolis of Athens. One seems to see a
      set of people who are fond of working in stone for its own sake, but who
      do not care to arrive at a mutual understanding in order to produce in
      common a single work, since they do not know that it is the conception of
      a grand whole which constitutes greatness in art. Hence the incompleteness
      of the monuments; there is not a tomb to which the relations of the
      deceased have deemed it fitting to give the finishing touches; there is
      everywhere a certain egotism, like that which in later times prevented the
      Mussulman monuments from enduring. A passing pleasure in art does not
      induce men to finish, since finishing requires a certain stiffness of
      will. In general, the ancient Phoenicians appear to have had the spirit of
      sculptors rather than of architects. They did not construct in great
      masses, but every one laboured on his own account. Hence there was no
      exact measurement, and no symmetry. Even the capitals of the columns at
      Um-el-Awamid are not alike; in the portions which most evidently
      correspond the details are different."<a href="#linknote-686"

    <p>
      Phoenician æsthetic art embraced sculpture, metal-casting, intaglio, and
      painting to a small extent. Situated as the Phoenicians were, in the
      immediate neighbourhood of nations which had practised from a remote
      antiquity the imitation of natural forms, and brought into contact by
      their commercial transactions with others, with whom art of every kind was
      in the highest esteem&mdash;adroit moreover with their hands, clever,
      active, and above all else practical&mdash;it was scarcely possible that
      they should not, at an early period in their existence as a nation,
      interest themselves in what they found so widely appreciated, and become
      themselves ambitious of producing such works as they saw everywhere
      produced, admired, and valued. The mere commercial instinct would lead
      them to supply a class of goods which commanded a high price in the
      world&rsquo;s markets; while it is not to be supposed that they were, any more
      than other nations, devoid of those æsthetic propensities which find a
      vent in what are commonly called the &ldquo;fine arts,&rdquo; or less susceptible of
      that natural pleasure which successful imitation evokes from all who find
      themselves capable of it. Thus, we might have always safely concluded,
      even without any material evidence of it, that the Phoenicians had an art
      of their own, either original or borrowed; but we are now able to do more
      than this. Recent researches in Phoenicia Proper, in Cyprus, in Sardina,
      and elsewhere, have recovered such a mass of Phoenician artistic remains,
      that it is possible to form a tolerably complete idea of the character of
      their æsthetic art, of its methods, its aims, and its value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phoenician sculpture, even at its best, is somewhat rude. The country
      possesses no marble, and has not even any stone of a fine grain. The
      cretaceous limestone, which is the principal geological formation, is for
      the most part so pierced with small holes and so thickly sown with fossil
      shells as to be quite unsuited for the chisel; and even the better blocks,
      which the native sculptors were careful to choose, are not free from these
      defects, and in no case offer a grain that is satisfactory. To meet these
      difficulties, the Phoenician sculptor occasionally imported his blocks
      either from Egypt or from the volcanic regions of Taurus and Amanus;<a
      href="#linknote-71" name="linknoteref-71" id="linknoteref-71">71</a> but
      it was not until he had transported himself to Cyprus, and found there an
      abundance of a soft, but fairly smooth, compact, and homogeneous
      limestone, that he worked freely, and produced either statues or
      bas-reliefs in any considerable number.<a href="#linknote-72"
       name="linknoteref-72" id="linknoteref-72">72</a> The Cyprian limestone is
      very easy to work. &ldquo;It is a whitish stone when it comes out of the quarry,
      but by continued exposure to the air the tone becomes a greyish yellow,
      which, though a little dull, is not disagreeable to the eye. The nail can
      make an impression on it, and it is worked by the chisel much more easily
      and more rapidly than marble. But it is in the plastic arts as in
      literature and poetry&mdash;what costs but little trouble has small chance
      of enduring. The Cyprian limestone is too soft to furnish the effects and
      the contrasts which marble offers, so to speak, spontaneously; it is
      incapable of receiving the charming polish which makes so strong an
      opposition to the dark shadows of the parts where the chisel has scooped
      deep. The chisel, whatever efforts it may make and however laboriously it
      may be applied, cannot impress on such material the strong and bold
      touches which indicate the osseous structure, and make the muscles and the
      veins show themselves under the epidermis in Greek statuary. The
      sculptor&rsquo;s work is apt to be at once finikin and lax; it wants breadth,
      and it wants decision. Moreover, the material, having little power of
      resistance, retains but ill what the chisel once impressed; the more
      delicate markings and the more lifelike touches that it once received, it
      loses easily through friction or exposure to rough weather. A certain
      number of the sculptured figures found by M. Di Cesnola at Athiénau were
      discovered under conditions that were quite peculiar, having passed from
      the shelter of a covered chamber to that of a protecting bed of dust,
      which had hardened and adhered to their surfaces; and these figures had
      preserved an unusual freshness, and seem as if just chiselled; but, saving
      these exceptions, the Cypriot figures have their angles rounded, and their
      projections softened down. It is like a page of writing, where the ink,
      before it had time to dry, preserving its sharpness of tone, has been
      absorbed by the blotting paper and has left only pale and feeble traces."<a
      href="#linknote-73" name="linknoteref-73" id="linknoteref-73">73</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Another striking defect in the Phoenician, or at any rate in the
      Cyprio-Phoenician, sculpture, and one that cannot be excused on account of
      any inherent weakness in the material, is the thinness and flatness of the
      greater part of the figures. The sculptor seems to have been furnished by
      the stonecutter, not so much with solid blocks of stone, as with tolerably
      thick slabs.<a href="#linknote-74" name="linknoteref-74"
       id="linknoteref-74">74</a> These he fashioned carefully in front, and
      produced statues, which, viewed in front, are lifelike and fairly
      satisfactory. But to the sides and back of the slab he paid little
      attention, not intending that his work should be looked at from all
      quarters, but that the spectator should directly face it. The statues were
      made to stand against walls,<a href="#linknote-75" name="linknoteref-75"
       id="linknoteref-75">75</a> or in niches, or back to back, the heels and
      backs touching;<a href="#linknote-76" name="linknoteref-76"
       id="linknoteref-76">76</a> they were not, properly speaking, works <i>in
      the round</i>, but rather <i>alti relievi</i> a little exaggerated, not
      actually part of the wall, but laid closely against it. A striking example
      of this kind of work may be seen in a figure now at New York, which
      appears to represent a priest, whereof a front view is given by Di Cesnola
      in his &ldquo;Cyprus,&rdquo; and a side view by Perrot and Chipiez in their &ldquo;History
      of Ancient Art.&rdquo; The head and neck are in good proportion, but the rest of
      the figure is altogether unduly thin, while for some space above the feet
      it is almost literally a slab, scarcely fashioned at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      This fault is less pronounced in some statues than in others, and from a
      certain number of the statuettes is wholly absent. This is notably the
      case in a figure found at Golgi, which represents a female arrayed in a
      long robe, the ample folds of which she holds back with one hand, while
      the other hand is advanced, and seems to have held a lotus flower. Three
      graceful tresses fall on either side of the neck, round which is a string
      of beads or pearls, with an amulet as pendant; while a long veil,
      surmounted by a diadem, hangs from the back of the head. This statue is in
      no respect narrow or flat, as may be seen especially from the side view
      given by Di Cesnola;<a href="#linknote-77" name="linknoteref-77"
       id="linknoteref-77">77</a> but it is short and inelegant, though not
      wanting in dignity; and it is disfigured by sandalled feet of a very
      disproportionate size, which stand out offensively in front. The figure
      has been viewed as a representation of the goddess Astarte or Ashtoreth;<a
      href="#linknote-78" name="linknoteref-78" id="linknoteref-78">78</a> but
      the identification can scarcely be regarded as more than a reasonable
      conjecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general defects of Phoenician statuary, besides want of finish and
      flatness, are a stiff and conventional treatment, recalling the art of
      Egypt and Assyria, a want of variety, and a want of life. Most of the
      figures stand evenly on the two feet, and have the arms pendant at the two
      sides, with the head set evenly, neither looking to the right nor to the
      left, while even the arrangement of the drapery is one of great
      uniformity. In the points where there is any variety, the variety is
      confined within very narrow limits. One foot may be a little advanced;<a
      href="#linknote-79" name="linknoteref-79" id="linknoteref-79">79</a> one
      arm may be placed across the breast, either as confined by the robe,<a
      href="#linknote-710" name="linknoteref-710" id="linknoteref-710">710</a>
      or as holding something, e.g. a bird or a flower.<a href="#linknote-711"
       name="linknoteref-711" id="linknoteref-711">711</a> In female figures both
      arms may be laid along the thighs,<a href="#linknote-712"
       name="linknoteref-712" id="linknoteref-712">712</a> or both be bent across
      the bosom, with the hands clasping the breasts,<a href="#linknote-713"
       name="linknoteref-713" id="linknoteref-713">713</a> or one hand may be so
      placed, and the other depend in front.<a href="#linknote-714"
       name="linknoteref-714" id="linknoteref-714">714</a> The hair and beard are
      mostly arranged with the utmost regularity in crisp curls, resembling the
      Assyrian; where tresses are worn, they are made to hang, whatever their
      number, with exact uniformity on either side.<a href="#linknote-715"
       name="linknoteref-715" id="linknoteref-715">715</a> Armlets and bracelets
      appear always in pairs, and are exactly similar; the two sides of a
      costume correspond perfectly; and in the groups the figures have, as
      nearly as possible, the same attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Repose is no doubt the condition of human existence which statuary most
      easily and most naturally expresses; and few things are more obnoxious to
      a refined taste than that sculpture which, like that of Roubiliac, affects
      movement, fidget, flutter, and unquiet. But in the Phoenician sculpture
      the repose is overdone; except in the expression of faces, there is
      scarcely any life at all. The figures do nothing; they simply stand to be
      looked at. And they stand stiffly, sometimes even awkwardly, rarely with
      anything like elegance or grace. The heads, indeed, have life and vigour,
      especially after the artists have become acquainted with Greek models;<a
      href="#linknote-716" name="linknoteref-716" id="linknoteref-716">716</a>
      but they are frequently too large for the bodies whereto they are
      attached, and the face is apt to wear a smirk that is exceedingly
      disagreeable. This is most noticeable in the Cypriot series, as will
      appear by the accompanying representations; but it is not confined to
      them, since it reappears in the bronzes found in Phoenicia Proper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phoenician statues are almost always more or less draped. Sometimes
      nothing is worn besides the short tunic, or <i>shenti</i>, of the
      Egyptians, which begins below the navel and terminates at the knee.<a
      href="#linknote-717" name="linknoteref-717" id="linknoteref-717">717</a>
      Sometimes there is added to this a close-fitting shirt, like a modern
      &ldquo;jersey,&rdquo; which has short sleeves and clings to the figure, so that it
      requires careful observation to distinguish between a statue thus draped
      and one which has the <i>shenti</i> only.<a href="#linknote-718"
       name="linknoteref-718" id="linknoteref-718">718</a> But there are also a
      number of examples where the entire figure is clothed from the head to the
      ankles, and nothing is left bare but the face, the hands, and the feet. A
      cap, something like a Phrygian bonnet, covers the head; a long-sleeved
      robe reaches from the neck to the ankles, or sometimes rests upon the
      feet; and above this is a mantle or scarf thrown over the left shoulder,
      and hanging down nearly to the knees. Ultimately a drapery greatly
      resembling that of the Greeks seems to have been introduced; a long cloak,
      or <i>chlamys</i>, is worn, which falls into numerous folds, and is
      disposed about the person according to the taste and fancy of the wearer,
      but so as to leave the right arm free.<a href="#linknote-719"
       name="linknoteref-719" id="linknoteref-719">719</a> Statues of this class
      are scarcely distinguishable from Greek statues of a moderately good type.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phoenician sculptors <i>in the round</i> did not very often indulge in the
      representation of animal forms. The lion, however, was sometimes chiselled
      in stone, either partially, as in a block of stone found by M. Renan at
      Um-el-Awamid, or completely, as in a statuette brought by General Di
      Cesnola from Cyprus. The representations hitherto discovered have not very
      much merit. We may gather from them that the sculptors were unacquainted
      with the animal itself, had never seen the king of beasts sleeping in the
      shade or stretching himself and yawning as he awoke, or walking along with
      a haughty and majestic slowness, or springing with one bound upon his
      prey, but had simply studied without much attention or interest the types
      furnished them by Egyptian or Assyrian artists, who were familiar with the
      beast himself. The representations are consequently in every case feeble
      and conventional; in some they verge on the ridiculous. What, for
      instance, can be weaker than the figure above given from the great work of
      Perrot and Chipiez, with its good-humoured face, its tongue hanging out of
      its mouth, its tottering forelegs, and its general air of imbecility? The
      lioness&rsquo; head represented in the same work is better, but still leaves
      much to be desired, falling, as it does, very far behind the best Assyrian
      models. Nor were the sculptors much more successful in their mode of
      expressing animals with whose forms they were perfectly well acquainted.
      The sheep carried on the back of a shepherd, brought from Cyprus and now
      in the museum of New York, is a very ill-shaped sheep, and the doves so
      often represented are very poor doves.<a href="#linknote-720"
       name="linknoteref-720" id="linknoteref-720">720</a> They are just
      recognisable, and that is the most that can be said for them. A dog in
      stone,<a href="#linknote-721" name="linknoteref-721" id="linknoteref-721">721</a>
      found at Athiénau, is somewhat better, equally the dogs of the Egyptians
      and Assyrians. On the other hand, the only fully modelled horses that have
      been found are utterly childish and absurd.<a href="#linknote-722"
       name="linknoteref-722" id="linknoteref-722">722</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The reliefs of the Phoenicians are very superior to their statues. They
      vary in their character from almost the lowest kind of relief to the
      highest. On dresses, on shields, on slabs, and on some sarcophagi it is
      much higher than is usual even in Greece. A bas-relief of peculiar
      interest was discovered at Athiénau by General Di Cesnola, and has been
      represented both by him and by the Italian traveller Ceccaldi.<a
      href="#linknote-723" name="linknoteref-723" id="linknoteref-723">723</a>
      It represents Hercules capturing the cattle of Geryon from the herdsman
      Eurytion, and gives us reason to believe that that myth was a native
      Phoenician legend adopted by the Greeks, and not a Hellenic one imported
      into Phoenicia. The general character of the sculpture is archaic and
      Assyrian; nor is there a trace of Greek influence about it. Hercules,
      standing on an elevated block of stone at the extreme left, threatens the
      herdsman, who responds by turning towards him, and making a menacing
      gesture with his right hand, while in his left, instead of a club, he
      carries an entire tree. His hair and beard are curled in the Assyrian
      fashion, while his figure, though short, is strong and muscular. In front
      of him are his cattle, mixed up in a confused and tangled mass, some
      young, but most of them full grown, and amounting to the number of
      seventeen. They are in various attitudes, and are drawn with much spirit,
      recalling groups of cattle in the sculptures of Assyria and Egypt, but
      surpassing any such group in the vigour of their life and movement. Above,
      in an upper field or plain, divided from the under one by a horizontal
      line, is the triple-headed dog, Orthros, running full speed towards
      Hercules, and scarcely checked by the arrow which has met him in mid
      career, and entered his neck at the point of junction between the second
      and the third head.<a href="#linknote-724" name="linknoteref-724"
       id="linknoteref-724">724</a> The bas-relief is three feet two inches in
      length, and just a little short of two feet in height. It served to
      ornament a huge block of stone which formed the pedestal of a colossal
      statue of Hercules, eight feet nine inches high.<a href="#linknote-725"
       name="linknoteref-725" id="linknoteref-725">725</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      A sarcophagus, on which the relief is low, has been described and figured
      by Di Cesnola,<a href="#linknote-726" name="linknoteref-726"
       id="linknoteref-726">726</a> who discovered it in the same locality as the
      sculpture which has just engaged our attention. The sarcophagus, which had
      a lid guarded by lions at the four corners, was ornamented at both ends
      and along both sides by reliefs. The four scenes depicted appear to be
      distinct and separate. At one end Perseus, having cut off Medusa&rsquo;s head
      and placed it in his wallet, which he carries behind him by means of a
      stick passed over his shoulder, departs homewards followed by his dog.
      Medusa&rsquo;s body, though sunk upon one knee, is still upright, and from the
      bleeding neck there spring the forms of Chrysaor and Pegasus. At the
      opposite end of the tomb is a biga drawn by two horses, and containing two
      persons, the charioteer and the owner, who is represented as bearded, and
      rests his hand upon the chariot-rim. The horse on the right hand, which
      can alone be distinctly seen, is well proportioned and spirited. He is
      impatient and is held in by the driver, and prevented from proceeding at
      more than a foot&rsquo;s pace. On the longer sides are a hunting scene, and a
      banqueting scene. In a wooded country, indicated by three tall trees, a
      party, consisting of five individuals, engages in the pleasures of the
      chase. Four of the five are accoutred like Greek soldiers; they wear
      crested helmets, cuirasses, belts, and a short tunic ending in a fringe:
      the arms which they carry are a spear and a round buckler or shield. The
      fifth person is an archer, and has a lighter equipment; he wears a cloth
      about his loins, a short tunic, and a round cap on his head. The design
      forms itself into two groups. On the right two of the spearmen are engaged
      with a wild boar, which they are wounding with their lances; on the left
      the two other spearmen and the archer are attacking a wild bull. In the
      middle a cock separates the two groups, while at the two extremities two
      animal forms, a horse grazing and a dog trying to make out a scent,
      balance each other. The fourth side of the sarcophagus presents us with a
      banqueting scene. On four couches, much like the Assyrian,<a
      href="#linknote-727" name="linknoteref-727" id="linknoteref-727">727</a>
      are arranged the banqueters. At the extreme right the couch is occupied by
      a single person, who has a long beard and extends a wine-cup towards an
      attendant, a naked youth, who is advancing towards him with a wine-jug in
      one hand, and a ladle or strainer in the other. The three other couches
      are occupied respectively by three couples, each comprising a male and a
      female. The male figure reclines in the usual attitude, half sitting and
      half lying, with the left arm supported on two pillows;<a
      href="#linknote-728" name="linknoteref-728" id="linknoteref-728">728</a>
      the female sits on the edge of the couch, with her feet upon a footstool.
      The males hold wine-cups; of the females, one plays upon the lyre, while
      the two others fondle with one hand their lover or husband. A fourth
      female figure, erect in the middle between the second and third couches,
      plays the double flute for the delectation of the entire party. All the
      figures, except the boy attendant, are decently draped, in robes with many
      folds, resembling the Greek. At the side of each couch is a table, on
      which are spread refreshments, while at the extreme left is a large bowl
      or amphora, from which the wine-cups may be replenished. This is placed
      under the shade of a tree, which tells us that the festivity takes place
      in a garden.<a href="#linknote-729" name="linknoteref-729"
       id="linknoteref-729">729</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      No one can fail to see, in this entire series of sculptures, the dominant
      influence of Greece. While the form of the tomb, and the lions that
      ornament the covering, are unmistakably Cyprio-Phoenician, the reliefs
      contain scarcely a feature which is even Oriental; all has markedly the
      colouring and the physiognomy of Hellenism. Yet Cyprian artists probably
      executed the work. There are little departures from Greek models, which
      indicate the &ldquo;barbarian&rdquo; workman, as the introduction of trees in the
      backgrounds, the shape of the furniture, the recurved wings of the Gorgon,
      and the idea of hunting the wild bull. But the figures, the proportions,
      the draperies, the attitudes, the chariot, the horse, are almost pure
      Greek. There is a grace and ease in the modelling, an elegance, a variety,
      to which Asiatic art, left to itself, never attained. The style, however,
      is not that of Greece at its best, but of archaic Greece. There is
      something too much of exact symmetry, both in the disposition of the
      groups and in the arrangement of the accessories; nay, even the very folds
      of the garments are over-stiff and regular. All is drawn in exact profile;
      and in the composition there is too much of balance and correspondence.
      Still, a new life shows itself through the scenes. There is variety in the
      movements; there is grace and suppleness in the forms; there is lightness
      in the outline, vigour in the attitudes, and beauty spread over the whole
      work. It cannot be assigned an earlier date than the fifth century B.C.,
      and is most probably later,<a href="#linknote-730" name="linknoteref-730"
       id="linknoteref-730">730</a> since it took time for improved style to
      travel from the head-centres of Greek art to the remoter provinces, and
      still more time for it to percolate through the different layers of Greek
      society until it reached the stratum of native Cyprian artistic culture.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may contrast with the refined work of the Athiénau sarcophagus the far
      ruder, but more genuinely native, designs of a tomb of the same kind found
      on the site of Amathus.<a href="#linknote-731" name="linknoteref-731"
       id="linknoteref-731">731</a> On this sarcophagus, the edges of which are
      most richly adorned with patterning, there are, as upon the other, four
      reliefs, two of them occupying the sides and two the ends. Those at the
      ends are curious, but have little artistic merit. They consist, in each
      case, of a caryatid figure four times repeated, representations,
      respectively, of Astarté and of a pygmy god, who, according to some, is
      Bes, and, according to others, Melkarth or Esmun.<a href="#linknote-732"
       name="linknoteref-732" id="linknoteref-732">732</a> The figures of Astarté
      are rude, as are generally her statues.<a href="#linknote-733"
       name="linknoteref-733" id="linknoteref-733">733</a> They have the hair
      arranged in three rows of crisp curls, the arms bent, and the hands
      supporting the breasts. The only ornament worn by them is a double
      necklace of pearls or round beads. The representations of the pygmy god
      have more interest. They remind us of what Herodotus affirms concerning
      the Phoenician <i>pataikoi</i>, which were used for the figure-heads of
      ships,<a href="#linknote-734" name="linknoteref-734" id="linknoteref-734">734</a>
      and which he compares to the Egyptian images of Phthah, or Ptah, the god
      of creation. They are ugly dwarf figures, with a large misshapen head, a
      bushy beard, short arms, fat bodies, a short striped tunic, and thick
      clumsy legs. Only one of the four figures is at present complete, the
      sarcophagus having been entered by breaking a hole into it at this end.
    </p>

      The work at the sides is much superior to that at the ends. The two panels
      represent, apparently, a single scene. The scene is a procession, but
      whether funeral or military it is hard to decide.<a href="#linknote-735"
       name="linknoteref-735" id="linknoteref-735">735</a> First come two riders
      on horseback, wearing conical caps and close-fitting jerkins; they are
      seated on a species of saddle, which is kept in place by a board girth
      passing round the horse&rsquo;s belly, and by straps attached in front. The two
      cavaliers are followed by four <i>bigæ</i>. The first contains the
      principal personages of the composition, who sits back in his car, and
      shades himself with a parasol, the mark of high rank in the East, while
      his charioteer sits in front of him and holds the reins. The second car
      has three occupants; the third two; and the fourth also two, one of whom
      leans back and converses with the footmen, who close the procession. These
      form a group of three, and seem to be soldiers, since they bear shield and
      spear; but their costume, a loose robe wrapped round the form, is rather
      that of civilians. The horses are lightly caparisoned, with little more
      than a head-stall and a collar; but they carry on their heads a
      conspicuous fan-like crest.<a href="#linknote-736" name="linknoteref-736"
       id="linknoteref-736">736</a> MM. Perrot and Chipiez thus sum up their
      description of this monument:&mdash;&ldquo;Both in the ornamentation and in the
      sculpture properly so-called there is a mixture of two traditions and two
      inspirations, diverse one from the other. The persons who chiselled the
      figures in the procession which fills the two principal sides of the
      sarcophagus were the pupils of Grecian statuaries; they understood how to
      introduce variety into the attitudes of those whom they represented, and
      even into the movements of the horses. Note, in this connection, the
      steeds of the two cavaliers in front; one of them holds up his head, the
      other bends it towards the ground. The draperies are also cleverly
      treated, especially those of the foot soldiers who bring up the rear, and
      resemble in many respects the costume of the Greeks. On the other hand,
      the types of divinity, repeated four times at the two ends of the
      monument, have nothing that is Hellenic about them, but are borrowed from
      the Pantheon of Phoenicia. Even in the procession itself&mdash;the train
      of horsemen, footmen, and chariots, which is certainly the sculptor&rsquo;s true
      subject&mdash;there are features which recall the local customs and usages
      of the East. The conical caps of the two cavaliers closely resemble those
      which we see on the heads of many of the Cyprian statues; the parasol
      which shades the head of the great person in the first <i>biga</i> is the
      symbol of Asiatic royalty; lastly, the fan-shaped plume which rises above
      the heads of all the chariot horses is an ornament that one sees in the
      same position in Assyria and in Lycia, whensoever the sculptor desires to
      represent horses magnificently caparisoned."<a href="#linknote-737"
       name="linknoteref-737" id="linknoteref-737">737</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sarcophagi recently exhumed in the vicinity of Sidon are said to be
      adorned with reliefs superior to any previously known specimens of
      Phoenician art. As, however, no drawings or photographs of these
      sculptures have as yet reached Western Europe, it will perhaps be
      sufficient in this place to direct attention to the descriptions of them
      which an eye-witness has published in the &ldquo;Journal de Beyrout."<a
      href="#linknote-738" name="linknoteref-738" id="linknoteref-738">738</a>
      No trustworthy critical estimate can be formed from mere descriptions, and
      it will therefore be necessary to reserve our judgment until the
      sculptures themselves, or correct representations of them, are accessible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The metal castings of the Phoenicians, according to the accounts which
      historians give of them, were of a very magnificent and extraordinary
      character. The Hiram employed by Solomon in the ornamentation of the
      Temple at Jerusalem, who was a native of Tyre,<a href="#linknote-739"
       name="linknoteref-739" id="linknoteref-739">739</a> designed and executed
      by his master&rsquo;s orders a number of works in metal, which seem to have been
      veritable masterpieces. The strangest of all were the two pillars of
      bronze, which bore the names of &ldquo;Jachin&rdquo; and &ldquo;Boaz,"<a href="#linknote-740"
       name="linknoteref-740" id="linknoteref-740">740</a> and stood in front of
      the Temple porch, or possibly under it.<a href="#linknote-741"
       name="linknoteref-741" id="linknoteref-741">741</a> These pillars, with
      their capitals, were between thirty-four and thirty-five feet high, and
      had a diameter of six feet.<a href="#linknote-742" name="linknoteref-742"
       id="linknoteref-742">742</a> They were cast hollow, the bronze whereof
      they were composed having a uniform thickness of three inches,<a
      href="#linknote-743" name="linknoteref-743" id="linknoteref-743">743</a>
      or thereabouts. Their ornamentation was elaborate. A sort of chain-work
      covered the &ldquo;belly&rdquo; or lower part of the capitals,<a href="#linknote-744"
       name="linknoteref-744" id="linknoteref-744">744</a> while above and below
      were representations of pomegranates in two rows, probably at the top and
      bottom of the &ldquo;belly,&rdquo; the number of the pomegranates upon each pillar
      being two hundred.<a href="#linknote-745" name="linknoteref-745"
       id="linknoteref-745">745</a> At the summit of the whole was a sort of
      &ldquo;lily-work"<a href="#linknote-746" name="linknoteref-746"
       id="linknoteref-746">746</a> or imitation of the lotus blossom, a &ldquo;motive&rdquo;
       adopted from Egypt. Various representations of the pillars have been
      attempted in works upon Phoenician art, the most remarkable being those
      designed by M. Chipiez, and published in the &ldquo;Histoire de l&rsquo;Art dans
      l&rsquo;Antiquité."<a href="#linknote-747" name="linknoteref-747"
       id="linknoteref-747">747</a> Perhaps, however, there is more to be said in
      favour of M. de Vogüé&rsquo;s view, as enunciated in his work on the Jewish
      Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third great work of metallurgy which Hiram constructed for Solomon was
      &ldquo;the molten sea."<a href="#linknote-748" name="linknoteref-748"
       id="linknoteref-748">748</a> This was an enormous bronze basin, fifteen
      feet in diameter, supported on the backs of twelve oxen, grouped in sets
      of three.<a href="#linknote-749" name="linknoteref-749"
       id="linknoteref-749">749</a> The basin stood fourteen or fifteen feet
      above the level of the Temple Court,<a href="#linknote-750"
       name="linknoteref-750" id="linknoteref-750">750</a> and was a vast
      reservoir, always kept full of water, for the ablutions of the priests.
      There was an ornamentation of &ldquo;knops&rdquo; or &ldquo;gourds,&rdquo; in two rows, about the
      &ldquo;brim&rdquo; of the reservoir; and it must have been supplied in its lower part
      with a set of stopcocks, by means of which the water could be drawn off
      when needed. Representations of the &ldquo;molten sea&rdquo; have been given by
      Mangeant, De Vogüé, Thenius, and others; but all of them are, necessarily,
      conjectural. The design of Mangeant is reproduced in the preceding
      representation. It is concluded that the oxen must have been of colossal
      size in order to bear a proper proportion to the basin, and not present
      the appearance of being crushed under an enormous weight.<a
      href="#linknote-751" name="linknoteref-751" id="linknoteref-751">751</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Next in importance to these three great works were ten minor ones, made
      for the Jewish Temple by the same artist. These were lavers mounted on
      wheels,<a href="#linknote-752" name="linknoteref-752" id="linknoteref-752">752</a>
      which could be drawn or pushed to any part of the Temple Court where water
      might be required. The lavers were of comparatively small size, capable of
      containing only one-fiftieth part<a href="#linknote-753"
       name="linknoteref-753" id="linknoteref-753">753</a> of the contents of the
      &ldquo;molten sea,&rdquo; but they were remarkable for their ornamentation. Each was
      supported upon a &ldquo;base;&rdquo; and the bases, which seem to have been panelled,
      contained, in the different compartments, figures of lions, oxen, and
      cherubim,<a href="#linknote-754" name="linknoteref-754"
       id="linknoteref-754">754</a> either single or in groups. On the top of the
      base, which seems to have been square, was a circular stand or socket, a
      foot and a half in height, into which the laver or basin fitted.<a
      href="#linknote-755" name="linknoteref-755" id="linknoteref-755">755</a>
      This, too, was panelled, and ornamented with embossed work, representing
      lions, cherubim, and palm-trees.<a href="#linknote-756"
       name="linknoteref-756" id="linknoteref-756">756</a> Each base was emplaced
      upon four wheels, which are said to have resembled chariot wheels, but
      which were molten in one piece, naves, spokes, and felloes together.<a
      href="#linknote-757" name="linknoteref-757" id="linknoteref-757">757</a> A
      restoration by M. Mangeant, given by Perrot and Chipiez in the fourth
      volume of their &ldquo;History of Ancient Art,&rdquo; is striking, and leaves little
      to be desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hiram is also said to have made for Solomon a number of pots, shovels,
      basins, flesh-hooks, and other instruments,<a href="#linknote-758"
       name="linknoteref-758" id="linknoteref-758">758</a> which were all used in
      the Temple service; but as no description is given of any of these works,
      even their general character can only be conjectured. We may, however,
      reasonably suppose them not to have differed greatly from the objects of a
      similar description found in Cyprus by General Di Cesnola.<a
      href="#linknote-759" name="linknoteref-759" id="linknoteref-759">759</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      From the conjectural, which may amuse, but can scarcely satisfy, the
      earnest student, it is fitting that we should now pass to the known and
      actual. Phoenician metal-work of various descriptions has been found
      recently in Phoenicia Proper, in Cyprus, and in Sardinia; and, though much
      of it consists of works of utility or of mere personal adornment, which
      belong to another branch of the present enquiry, there is a considerable
      portion which is more or less artistic and which rightly finds its place
      in the present chapter. The Phoenicians, though they did not, so far as we
      know, attempt with any frequency the production, in bronze or other metal,
      of the full-sized human form,<a href="#linknote-760" name="linknoteref-760"
       id="linknoteref-760">760</a> were fond of fabricating, especially in
      bronze, the smaller kinds of figures which are known as &ldquo;figurines&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;statuettes.&rdquo; They also had a special talent for producing embossed
      metal-work of a highly artistic character in the shape of cups, bowls, and
      dishes or <i>pateræ</i>, whereon scenes of various kinds were represented
      with a vigour and precision that are quite admirable. Some account of
      these two classes of works must here be given.
    </p>
    <p>
      The statuettes commence with work of the rudest kind. The Phoenician sites
      in Sardinia have yielded in abundance grotesque figures of gods and men,<a
      href="#linknote-761" name="linknoteref-761" id="linknoteref-761">761</a>
      from three or four to six or eight inches high, which must be viewed as
      Phoenician productions, though perhaps they were not the best works which
      Phoenician artists could produce, but such as were best suited to the
      demands of the Sardinian market. The savage Sards would not have
      appreciated beauty or grace; but to the savage mind there is something
      congenial in grotesqueness. Hence gods with four arms and four eyes,<a
      href="#linknote-762" name="linknoteref-762" id="linknoteref-762">762</a>
      warriors with huge horns projecting from their helmets,<a
      href="#linknote-763" name="linknoteref-763" id="linknoteref-763">763</a>
      tall forms of extraordinary leanness,<a href="#linknote-764"
       name="linknoteref-764" id="linknoteref-764">764</a> figures with
      abnormally large heads and hands,<a href="#linknote-765"
       name="linknoteref-765" id="linknoteref-765">765</a> huge noses, projecting
      eyes, and various other deformities. For the home consumption statuettes
      of a similar character were made; but they were neither so rude nor so
      devoid of artistic merit. There is one in the Louvre, which was found at
      Tortosa, in Northern Phoenicia, approaching nearly to the Sardinian type,
      while others have less exaggeration, and seem intended seriously. In
      Cyprus bronzes of a higher order have been discovered.<a
      href="#linknote-766" name="linknoteref-766" id="linknoteref-766">766</a>
      One is a figure of a youth, perhaps Æsculapius, embracing a serpent;
      another is a female form of much elegance, which may have been the handle
      of a vase or jug; it springs from a grotesque bracket, and terminates in a
      bar ornamented at either end with heads of animals. The complete bronze
      figure found near Curium, which is supposed to represent Apollo and is
      figured by Di Cesnola,<a href="#linknote-767" name="linknoteref-767"
       id="linknoteref-767">767</a> is probably not the production of a
      Phoenician artists, but a sculpture imported from Greece.
    </p>
    <p>
      The embossed work upon cups and <i>pateræ</i> is sometimes of great
      simplicity, sometimes exceedingly elaborate. A patera of the simplest kind
      was found by General Di Cesnola in the treasury of Curium and is figured
      in his work.<a href="#linknote-768" name="linknoteref-768"
       id="linknoteref-768">768</a> At the bottom of the dish, in the middle, is
      a rosette with twenty-two petals springing from a central disk; this is
      surrounded by a ring whereon are two wavy lines of ribbon intertwined.
      Four deer, with strongly recurved horns, spaced at equal intervals, stand
      on the outer edge of the ring in a walking attitude. Behind them and
      between them are a continuous row of tall stiff reeds terminating in
      blossoms, which are supposed to represent the papyrus plant. The reeds are
      thirty-two in number. We may compare with this the medallion at the bottom
      of a cup found at Cære in Italy, which has been published by Grifi.<a
      href="#linknote-769" name="linknoteref-769" id="linknoteref-769">769</a>
      Here, on a chequered ground, stands a cow with two calves, one engaged in
      providing itself with its natural sustenance, the other disporting itself
      in front of its dam. In the background are a row of alternate papyrus
      blossoms and papyrus buds bending gracefully to the right and to the left,
      so as to form a sort of framework to the main design. Above the cow and in
      front of the papyrus plants two birds wing their flight from left to right
      across the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bronze bowl, discovered at Idalium (Dali) in Cyprus,<a
      href="#linknote-770" name="linknoteref-770" id="linknoteref-770">770</a>
      is, like these specimens, Egyptian in its motive, but is more ambitious in
      that it introduces the human form. On a throne of state sits a goddess,
      draped in a long striped robe which reaches to the feet, and holding a
      lotus flower in her right hand and a ball or apple in her left. Bracelets
      adorn her wrists and anklets her feet. Behind her stands a band of three
      instrumental performers, all of them women, and somewhat variously
      costumed: the first plays the double pipe, the second performs on a lyre
      or harp, the third beats the tambourine. In front of the goddess is a
      table or altar, to which a votary approaches bringing offerings. Then
      follows another table whereon two vases are set; finally comes a
      procession of six females, holding hands, who are perhaps performing a
      solemn dance. Behind them are a row of lotus pillars, the supports
      probably of a temple, wherein the scene takes place. The human forms in
      this design are ill-proportioned, and very rudely traced. The heads and
      hands are too large, the faces are grotesque, and the figures wholly
      devoid of grace. Mimetic art is seen clearly in its first stage, and the
      Phoenician artist who has designed the bowl has probably fallen short of
      his Egyptian models.
    </p>
    <p>
      Animal and human forms intermixed occur on a silver <i>patera</i> found at
      Athiénau, which is more complicated and elaborate than the objects
      hitherto described, but which is, like them, strikingly Egyptian.<a
      href="#linknote-771" name="linknoteref-771" id="linknoteref-771">771</a> A
      small rosette occupies the centre; round it is, apparently, a pond or
      lake, in which fish are disporting themselves; but the fish are intermixed
      with animal and human forms&mdash;a naked female stretches out her arms
      after a cow; a man clothed in a <i>shenti</i> endeavours to seize a horse.
      The pond is edged by papyrus plants, which are alternately in blossom and
      in bud. A zigzag barrier separates this central ornamentation from that of
      the outer part of the dish. Here a marsh is represented in which are
      growing papyrus and other water-plants. Aquatic birds swim on the surface
      or fly through the tall reeds. Four boats form the chief objects in this
      part of the field. In one, which is fashioned like a bird, there sits
      under a canopy a grandee, with an attendant in front and a rower or
      steersman at the stern. Behind him, in a second boat, is a band consisting
      of three undraped females, one of whom plays a harp and another a
      tambourine, while the third keeps time with her hands. A man with a
      punt-pole directs the vessel from the stern. In the third boat, which has
      a freight of wine-jars, a cook is preparing a bird for the grandee&rsquo;s
      supper. The fourth boat contains three rowers, who possibly have the
      vessel of the grandee in tow. The first and second boats are separated by
      two prancing steeds, the second and third by two cows, the third and
      fourth by a chariot and pair. It is difficult to explain the mixture of
      the aquatic with the terrestrial in this piece; but perhaps the grandee is
      intended to be enjoying himself in a marshy part of his domain, where he
      might ride, drive, or boat, according to his pleasure. The whole scene is
      rather Egyptian than Phoenician or Cypriot, and one cannot help suspecting
      that the <i>patera</i> was made for an Egyptian customer.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a <i>patera</i> at Athens,<a href="#linknote-772"
       name="linknoteref-772" id="linknoteref-772">772</a> almost certainly
      Phoenician, which may well be selected to introduce the more elaborate and
      complicated of the Phoenician works of art in this class. It has been
      figured,<a href="#linknote-773" name="linknoteref-773" id="linknoteref-773">773</a>
      and carefully described by MM. Perrot and Chipiez in these terms:&mdash;&ldquo;The
      medallion in the centre is occupied by a rosette with eight points. The
      zone outside this, in which are distributed the personages represented, is
      divided into four compartments by four figures, which correspond to each
      other in pairs. They lift themselves out of a trellis-work, bounded on
      either side by a light pillar without a base. The capitals which crown the
      pillars recall those of the Ionic order, but the abacus is much more
      developed. A winged globe, stretching from pillar to pillar, roofs in this
      sort of little chapel; each is the shrine of a divinity. One of the
      divinities is that nude goddess, clasping her breasts with her hands, whom
      we have already met with in the Phoenician world more than once; the other
      is a bearded personage, whose face is framed in by his abundant hair; he
      appears to be dressed in a close-fitting garment, made of a material
      folded in narrow plaits. We do not know what name to give the personage.
      Each of the figures is repeated twice. The rest of the field is occupied
      by four distinct subjects, two of them being scenes of adoration. In one
      may be recognised the figure of Isis-Athor, seated on a sort of
      camp-stool, and giving suck to the young Horus;<a href="#linknote-774"
       name="linknoteref-774" id="linknoteref-774">774</a> on an altar in front
      of the goddess is placed the disk of the moon, enveloped (as we have seen
      it elsewhere) by a crescent which recalls the moon&rsquo;s phases. Behind the
      altar stands a personage whose sex is not defined; the right hand, which
      is raised, holds a <i>patera</i>, while the left, which falls along the
      hip, has the <i>ankh</i> or <i>crux ansata</i>. Another of the scenes
      corresponds to this, and offers many striking analogies. The altar indeed
      is of a different form, but it supports exactly the same symbols. The
      goddess sits upon a throne with her feet on a footstool; she has no child;
      in one hand she holds out a cup, in the other a lotus blossom. The
      personage who confronts her wears a conical cap, and is clothed, like the
      worshipper of the corresponding representation, in a long robe pressed
      close to the body by a girdle <i>à cordelière</i>; he has also the <i>crux
      ansata</i>, and holds in the right hand an object the character and use of
      which I am unable to conjecture. We may associate with these two scenes of
      homage and worship another representation in which there figure three
      musicians. The instruments are the same as usual&mdash;the lyre, the
      tambourine, and the double pipe; two of the performers march at a steady
      pace; the third, the one who beats the metal(?) disk, dances, as he plays,
      with much vigour and spirit. In the last compartment we come again upon a
      group that we have already met with in one of the cups from Idalium.<a
      href="#linknote-775" name="linknoteref-775" id="linknoteref-775">775</a> .
      . . A beardless individual, clothed in the <i>shenti</i>, has put his foot
      upon the body of a griffin, which, in struggling against the pressure,
      flings its hind quarters into the air in a sort of wild caper; the
      conqueror, however, holds it fast by the plume of feathers which rises
      from its head, and plunges his sword into its half-open beak. It is this
      group, drawn in relief, and on a larger scale, that we meet with for a
      second time on the Athenian <i>patera</i>; but in this case the group is
      augmented by a second personage, who takes part in the struggle. This is
      an old man with a beard who is armed with a formidable pike. Both the
      combatants wear conical caps upon their heads, similar to those which we
      have noticed as worn by a number of the statues from Cyprus; but the cap
      of the right-hand personage terminates in a button, whereto is attached a
      long appendage, which looks like the tail of an ox.&rdquo; The Egyptian
      character of much of this design is incontestable. The <i>ankh</i>, the
      lotus blossom in the hand, the winged disk, are purely Egyptian forms; the
      Isis Athor with Horus in her lap speaks for itself; and the worshipper in
      front of Isis has an unmistakably Egyptian head dress. But the contest
      with the winged griffin is more Assyrian than Egyptian; the seat whereon
      Isis sits recalls a well-known Assyrian type;<a href="#linknote-776"
       name="linknoteref-776" id="linknoteref-776">776</a> one of the altars has
      a distinctly Assyrian character, while the band of musicians, the Astarté
      figures standing in their shrines, and the pillars which support, and
      frame in, the shrines are genuine Phoenician contributions. Artistically
      this <i>patera</i> is much upon a par with those from Dali and Athiénau,
      which have been already described.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our space will not admit of our pursuing this subject much further. We
      cannot give descriptions of all the twenty <i>pateræ</i>,<a
      href="#linknote-777" name="linknoteref-777" id="linknoteref-777">777</a>
      pronounced by the best critics to be Phoenician, which are contained in
      the museums of Europe and America. Excellent representations of most of
      these works of art will be found in Longpérier&rsquo;s &ldquo;Musée Napoléon III.,&rdquo; in
      M. Clermont-Ganneau&rsquo;s &ldquo;Imagerie Phénicienne,&rdquo; and in the &ldquo;Histoire de
      l&rsquo;Art dans l&rsquo;Antiquité&rdquo; of MM. Perrot et Chipiez. The bowls brought from
      Larnaca, from Curium, and from Amathus are especially interesting.<a
      href="#linknote-778" name="linknoteref-778" id="linknoteref-778">778</a>
      We must, however, conclude our survey with a single specimen of the most
      elaborate kind of <i>patera</i>; and, this being the case, we cannot
      hesitate to give the preference to the famous &ldquo;Cup of Præneste,&rdquo; which has
      been carefully figured and described in two of the three works above
      cited.<a href="#linknote-779" name="linknoteref-779" id="linknoteref-779">779</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The cup in question consists of a thin plate of silver covered over with a
      layer of gold; its greatest diameter is seven inches and three-fifths. The
      under or outside is without ornament; the interior is engraved with a
      number of small objects in low relief. In the centre, and surrounded by a
      circle of beads, there is a subject to which we shall presently have to
      return. The zone immediately outside this medallion, which is not quite an
      inch in width, is filled with a string of eight horses, all of them
      proceeding at a trot, and following each other to the right. Over each
      horse two birds fly in the same direction. The horses&rsquo; tails are
      extraordinarily conventional, consisting of a stem with branches, and
      resembling a conventional palm branch. Outside this zone there is an
      exterior and a wider one, which is bounded on its outer edge by a huge
      snake, whose scaly length describes an almost exact circle, excepting
      towards the tail, where there are some slight sinuosities. This serpent,
      whose head reaches and a little passes the thin extremity of the tail, is
      &ldquo;drawn,&rdquo; says M. Clermont-Ganneau, &ldquo;with the hand of a master."<a
      href="#linknote-780" name="linknoteref-780" id="linknoteref-780">780</a>
      It has been compared<a href="#linknote-781" name="linknoteref-781"
       id="linknoteref-781">781</a> with the well-known Egyptian and Phoenician
      symbol for the {kosmos} or universe, which was a serpent with its tail in
      its mouth. &ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; he continues,<a href="#linknote-782"
       name="linknoteref-782" id="linknoteref-782">782</a> &ldquo;the outer zone by its
      very position offers the greatest room for development. The artist is here
      at his ease, and having before him a field relatively so vast, has
      represented on it a series of scenes, remarkably alike for the style of
      their execution, the diversity of their subject-matter, the number of the
      persons introduced, and the nature of the acts which they accomplish. . .
      . The scenes, however, are not, as some have imagined, a series of
      detached fantastic subjects, arbitrarily chosen and capriciously grouped,
      a mere confused <i>mêlée</i> of men, animals, chariots, and other objects;
      on the contrary, they form a little history, a plastic idyll, a story with
      a beginning, a middle, and an end. It is a narrative divided into nine
      scenes.&rdquo; (1) An armed hero, mounted in a car driven by a charioteer, quits
      in the morning a castle or fortified town. He is going to hunt, and
      carries his bow in his left hand. Over his head is an umbrella, the badge
      of his high rank, and his defence against the mid-day sun. A quiver hangs
      at the side of his chariot. He wears a conical cap, while the driver has
      his head bare, and leans forwards over the front of the car, seeming to
      shake the reins, and encourage the horses to mend their pace. (2) After
      the car has proceeded a certain distance, the hunter espies a stag upon a
      rocky hill. He stops his chariot, gets down, and leaving the driver in
      charge of the vehicle, ensconces himself behind a tree, and thus screened
      lets fly an arrow against the quarry, which strikes it midway in the
      chest. (3) Weak and bleeding copiously, the stag attempts to escape; but
      the hunter pursues and takes possession of him without having to shoot a
      second time. (4) The hour is come now for a rest. The sportsman has
      reached a wood, in which date-bearing palms are intermingled with trees of
      a different kind. He fastens his game to one of them, and proceeds to the
      skinning and the disembowelling. Meanwhile, his attendant detaches the
      horses from the car, relieves them of their harness, and proceeds to feed
      them from a portable manger. The car, left to itself, is tilted back, and
      stands with its pole in the air. (5) Food and drink having been prepared
      and placed on two tables, or altars, the hunter, seated on a throne under
      the shadow of his umbrella, pours a libation to the gods. They, on their
      part, scent the feast and draw near, represented by the sun and moon&mdash;a
      winged disk, and a crescent embracing a full orb. The feast is also
      witnessed by a spirit of evil, in the shape of a huge baboon or
      cynocephalous ape, who from a cavern at the foot of a wooded mountain,
      whereon a stag and a hare are feeding, furtively surveys the ceremony. (6)
      Remounting his chariot the hunter sets out on his return home, when the
      baboon quits his concealment, and rushes after him, threatening him with a
      huge stone. Hereupon a winged deity descends from heaven, and lifting into
      the air chariot, horses, charioteer, and hunter, enfolds them in an
      embrace and saves them. (7) The ape, baffled, pursues his way; the chariot
      is replaced on the earth. The hunter prepares his bow, places an arrow on
      the string, and hastily pursues his enemy, who is speedily overtaken and
      thrown to the ground by the horses. (8) The hunter dismounts, puts his
      foot upon the prostrate ape, and gives him the <i>coup de grâce</i> with a
      heavy axe or mace. A bird of prey hovers near, ready to descend upon the
      carcase. (9) The hero remounts his chariot, and returns to the castle or
      city which he left in the morning.<a href="#linknote-783"

    </p>
    <p>
      We have now to return to the medallion which forms the centre of the cup.
      Within a circle of pearls or beads, similar to that separating the two
      zones, is a round space about two inches in diameter, divided into two
      compartments by a horizontal line. In the upper part are contained three
      human figures, and the figure of a dog. At the extreme left is a prisoner
      with a beard and long hair that falls upon his shoulders. His entire body
      is naked. Behind him his two arms are brought together, tied by a cord,
      and then firmly attached to a post. His knees are bent, but do not reach
      the ground, and his feet are placed with their soles uppermost against the
      post at its base. The attitude is one which implies extreme suffering.<a
      href="#linknote-784" name="linknoteref-784" id="linknoteref-784">784</a>
      In front of the prisoner, occupying the centre of the medallion, is the
      main figure of the upper compartment, a warrior, armed with a spear, who
      pursues the third figure, a fugitive, and seems to be thrusting his spear
      into the man&rsquo;s back. Both have long hair, but are beardless; and wear the
      <i>shenti</i> for their sole garment. Between the legs of the main figure
      is a dog of the jackal kind, which has his teeth fixed in the heels of the
      fugitive, and arrests his flight. Below, in the second compartment, are
      two figures only, a man and a dog. The man is prostrate, and seems to be
      crawling along the ground, the dog stands partly on him, and appears to be
      biting his left heel. The interpretation which M. Clermont-Ganneau gives
      to this entire scene lacks the probability which attaches to his
      explanation of the outer scene. He suggests that the prisoner is the
      hunter of the other scene, plundered and bound by his charioteer, who is
      hastening away, when he is seized by his master&rsquo;s dog and arrested in his
      flight. The dog gnaws off his right foot and then attacks the left, while
      the fugitive, in order to escape his tormentor, has to crawl along the
      ground. But M. Clermont-Ganneau himself distrusts his interpretation,<a
      href="#linknote-785" name="linknoteref-785" id="linknoteref-785">785</a>
      while he has convinced no other scholar of its soundness. Judicious
      critics will be content to wait the further researches which he promises,
      whereby additional light may perhaps be thrown on this obscure matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      In its artistic character the &ldquo;cup of Præneste&rdquo; claims a high place among
      the works of art probably or certainly assignable to the Phoenicians. The
      relief is high; the forms, especially the animal ones, are spirited and
      well-proportioned. The horses are especially good. As M. Clermont-Ganneau
      says, &ldquo;their forms and their movements are indicated with a great deal of
      precision and truth."<a href="#linknote-786" name="linknoteref-786"
       id="linknoteref-786">786</a> They show also a fair amount of variety; they
      stand, they walk, they trot, they gallop at full speed, always truthfully
      and naturally. The stag, the hare, and the dog are likewise well
      portrayed; the ape has less merit; he is too human, too like a mere
      unkempt savage. The human forms are about upon a par with those of the
      Assyrians and Egyptians, which have evidently served for their models, the
      Assyrian for the outer zone, the Egyptian for the medallion. The
      encircling snake, as already observed, is a masterpiece. There is no
      better drawing in any of the other <i>pateræ</i>. At best they equal, they
      certainly do not surpass, the Prænestine specimen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intaglios of the Phoenicians are either on cylinders or on gems, and
      can rarely be distinguished, unless they are accompanied by an
      inscription, from the similar objects obtained in such abundance from
      Babylonia and Assyria. They reproduce, with scarcely any variation, the
      mythological figures and emblems native to those countries&mdash;the forms
      of gods and priests, of spirits of good and evil, of kings contending with
      lions, of sacred trees, winged circles, and the like&mdash;scarcely ever
      introducing any novelty. The greater number of the cylinders are very
      rudely cut. They have been worked simply by means of a splinter of
      obsidian,<a href="#linknote-787" name="linknoteref-787"
       id="linknoteref-787">787</a> and are barbarous in execution, though
      interesting to the student of archaic art. The subjoined are specimens.
      No. 1 represents a four-winged genius of the Assyrian type, bearded, and
      clad in a short tunic and a long robe, seizing with either hand a winged
      griffin, or spirit of evil, and reducing them to subjection. In the field,
      towards the two upper corners, are the same four Phoenician characters,
      twice repeated; they designate, no doubt, the owner of the cylinder, which
      he probably used as a seal, and are read as <i>Harkhu</i>.<a
      href="#linknote-788" name="linknoteref-788" id="linknoteref-788">788</a>
      No. 2, which is better cut than No. 1, represents a king of the Persian
      (Achæmenian) type,<a href="#linknote-789" name="linknoteref-789"
       id="linknoteref-789">789</a> who stands between two rampant lions, and
      seizes each by the forelock. Behind the second lion is a sacred tree of a
      type that is not uncommon; and behind the tree is an inscription, which
      has been read as <i>l&rsquo;Baletân</i>&mdash;i.e. &ldquo;(the seal) of Baletan."<a
      href="#linknote-790" name="linknoteref-790" id="linknoteref-790">790</a>
      This cylinder was found recently in the Lebanon.<a href="#linknote-791"
       name="linknoteref-791" id="linknoteref-791">791</a> Nos. 3 and 4 come from
      Salamis in Cyprus, where they were found by M. Alexandre Di Cesnola,<a
      href="#linknote-792" name="linknoteref-792" id="linknoteref-792">792</a>
      the brother of the General. No. 3 represents a robed figure holding two
      nondescript animals by the hind legs; the creatures writhe in his grasp,
      and turn their heads towards him, as though wishing to bite. The remainder
      of the field is filed with detached objects, scattered at random&mdash;two
      human forms, a griffin, two heads of oxen, a bird, two balls, three
      crosses, a sceptre, &amp;c. The forms are, all of them, very rudely
      traced. No. 4 resembles in general character No. 3, but is even ruder.
      Three similar robed figures hold each other&rsquo;s hands and perhaps execute a
      dance around some religious object. Two heads of oxen or cows, with a disk
      between their horns, occupy the spaces intervening between the upper parts
      of the figures. In the lower portion of the field, the sun and moon fill
      the middle space, the sun, moon, and five planets the spaces to the right
      and to the left. Another cylinder from the same place (No. 5)<a
      href="#linknote-793" name="linknoteref-793" id="linknoteref-793">793</a>
      is tolerably well designed and engraved. It shows us two persons, a man
      and a woman, in the act of presenting a dove to a female, who is probably
      the goddess Astarté, and who willingly receives it at their hands. Behind
      Astarté a seated lion echoes the approval of the goddess by raising one of
      his fore paws, while a griffin, who wholly disapproves of the offering,
      turns his back in disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      On another cylinder, which is certainly Phoenician, a rude representation
      of a sacred tree occupies the central position. To the left stands a
      worshipper with the right hand upraised, clad in a very common Assyrian
      dress. Over the sacred tree is a coarse specimen of the winged circle or
      disk, with head and tail, and fluttering ends of ribbon.<a
      href="#linknote-794" name="linknoteref-794" id="linknoteref-794">794</a>
      On either side stand two winged genii, dressed in long robes, and tall
      stiff caps, such as are often seen on the heads of Persians in the
      Persepolitan sculptures, and on the darics.<a href="#linknote-795"
       name="linknoteref-795" id="linknoteref-795">795</a> In the field is a
      Phoenician inscription, which is read as {...} or <i>Irphael ben Hor&rsquo;adad</i>,
      &ldquo;Irphael, the son of Horadad."<a href="#linknote-796"
       name="linknoteref-796" id="linknoteref-796">796</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Phoenician cylinders are in glass, green serpentine, cornaline, black
      hæmatite, steatite, and green jasper.<a href="#linknote-797"
       name="linknoteref-797" id="linknoteref-797">797</a> They are scratched
      rather than deeply cut, and cannot be said ever to attain to any
      considerable artistic beauty. Those which have been here given are among
      the best; and they certainly fall short, both in design and workmanship,
      of many Assyrian, Babylonian, and even Persian specimens.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gems, on the other hand, are in many cases quite equal to the
      Assyrian. There is one of special merit, which has been pronounced &ldquo;an
      exquisite specimen of Phoenician lapidary art,"<a href="#linknote-798"
       name="linknoteref-798" id="linknoteref-798">798</a> figured by General Di
      Cesnola in his &ldquo;Cyprus."<a href="#linknote-799" name="linknoteref-799"
       id="linknoteref-799">799</a> Two men in regular Assyrian costume, standing
      on either side of a &ldquo;Sacred Tree,&rdquo; grasp, each of them, a branch of it.
      Above is a winged circle, with the wings curved so as to suit the shape of
      the gem. Below is an ornament, which is six times repeated, like the
      blossom of a flower; and below this is a trelliswork. The whole is cut
      deeply and sharply. Its Phoenician authorship is assured by its being an
      almost exact repetition of a group upon the silver patera found at
      Amathus.<a href="#linknote-7100" name="linknoteref-7100"       id="linknoteref-7100">7100</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Of other gems equally well engraved the following are specimens. No. 1 is
      a scarab of cornaline found by M. de Vogüé in Phoenicia Proper.<a
      href="#linknote-7101" name="linknoteref-7101" id="linknoteref-7101">7101</a>
      Two male figures in Assyrian costume face each other, their advanced feet
      crossing. Both hold in one hand the <i>ankh</i> or symbol of life. One has
      in the left hand what is thought to be a lotus blossom. The other has the
      right hand raised in the usual attitude of adoration. Between the figures,
      wherever there was space for them, are Phoenician characters, which are
      read as {...}, or <i>l&rsquo;Beka</i>&mdash;i.e. &ldquo;(the seal) of Beka."<a
      href="#linknote-7102" name="linknoteref-7102" id="linknoteref-7102">7102</a>
      No. 2, which has been set in a ring, is one of the many scarabs brought by
      General Di Cesnola from Cyprus.<a href="#linknote-7103"       name="linknoteref-7103" id="linknoteref-7103">7103</a> It contains the
      figure of a hind, suckling her fawn, and is very delicately carved. The
      hind, however, is in an impossible attitude, the forelegs being thrown
      forwards, probably in order to prevent them from interfering with the
      figure of the fawn. Above the hind is an inscription, which appears to be
      in the Cyprian character, and which gives (probably) the name of the
      owner. No. 3 introduces us to domestic life. A grand lady, of Tyre perhaps
      or Sidon,<a href="#linknote-7104" name="linknoteref-7104"       id="linknoteref-7104">7104</a> by name Akhot-melek, seated upon an elegant
      throne, with her feet upon a footstool, and dressed in a long robe which
      envelops the whole of her figure, receives at the hands of a female
      attendant a bowl or wine-cup, which the latter has just filled from an <i>oenochoë</i>
      of elegant shape, still held in her left hand. The attendant wears a
      striped robe reaching to the feet, and over it a tunic fastened round the
      waist with a belt. Her hair flows down on her shoulders, while that of her
      mistress is confined by a band, from which depends an ample veil,
      enveloping the cheeks, the back of the head, and the chin. We are told
      that such veils are still worn in the Phoenician country.<a
      href="#linknote-7105" name="linknoteref-7105" id="linknoteref-7105">7105</a>
      An inscription, in a late form of the Phoenician character, surrounds the
      two figures, and is read as {...} or <i>l&rsquo;Akhot-melek ishat Joshua(?)</i>&mdash;i.e.
      &ldquo;(the seal) of Akhot-melek, wife of Joshua."<a href="#linknote-7106"       name="linknoteref-7106" id="linknoteref-7106">7106</a> No. 4 contains the
      figure of a lion, cut with much spirit. MM. Perrot et Chipiez say of it&mdash;&ldquo;Among
      the numerous representations of lions that have been discovered in
      Phoenicia, there is none which can be placed on a par with that on the
      scarab bearing the name of &lsquo;Ashenel: small as it is, this lion has
      something of the physiognomy of those magnificent ones which we have
      borrowed from the bas-reliefs of the Assyrians. Still, the intaglio is in
      other respects decidedly Phoenician and not Assyrian. Observe, for
      instance, the beetle with the wings expanded, which fills up the lower
      part of the field; this is a <i>motive</i> borrowed from Egypt, which a
      Ninevite lapidary would certainly not have put in such a place."<a
      href="#linknote-7107" name="linknoteref-7107" id="linknoteref-7107">7107</a>
      The Phoenician inscription takes away all doubt as to the nationality. It
      reads as {...}, or <i>&rsquo;Ashenêl</i>, and no doubt designates the owner. No.
      5 is beautifully engraved on a chalcedony. It represents a stag attacked
      by a griffin, which has jumped suddenly on its back. The drawing is
      excellent, both of the real and of the imaginary animal, and leaves
      nothing to be desired. The inscription, which occupies the upper part of
      the field to the right, is in Cyprian characters, and shows that the gem
      was the signet of a certain Akestodaros.<a href="#linknote-7108"       name="linknoteref-7108" id="linknoteref-7108">7108</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some Phoenician gems which are interesting from their subject
      matter without being especially good as works of art. One of these
      contains a representation of two men fighting.<a href="#linknote-7109"       name="linknoteref-7109" id="linknoteref-7109">7109</a> Both are armed with
      two spears, and both carry round shields or bucklers. The warrior to the
      right wears a conical helmet, and is thought to be a native Cyprian;<a
      href="#linknote-7110" name="linknoteref-7110" id="linknoteref-7110">7110</a>
      he carries a shield without an <i>umbo</i> or boss. His adversary on the
      left wears a loose cap, or hood, the {pilos apages} of Herodotus,<a
      href="#linknote-7111" name="linknoteref-7111" id="linknoteref-7111">7111</a>
      and has a prominent <i>umbo</i> in the middle of his shield. He probably
      represents a Persian, and appears to have received a wound from his
      antagonist, which is causing him to sink to the ground. This gem was found
      at Curium in Cyprus by General Di Cesnola.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another, found at the same place, exhibits a warrior, or a hunter, going
      forth to battle or to the chase in his chariot.<a href="#linknote-7112"       name="linknoteref-7112" id="linknoteref-7112">7112</a> A large quiver full
      of arrows is slung at each side of his car. The warrior and his horse (one
      only is seen) are rudely drawn, but the chariot is very distinctly made
      out, and has a wheel of an Assyrian type. The Salaminians of Cyprus were
      famous for their war chariots,<a href="#linknote-7113"       name="linknoteref-7113" id="linknoteref-7113">7113</a> of which this may
      be a representation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The island of Sardinia has furnished a prodigious number of Phoenician
      seals. A single private collection contains as many as six hundred.<a
      href="#linknote-7114" name="linknoteref-7114" id="linknoteref-7114">7114</a>
      They are mostly scarabs, and the type of them is mostly Egyptian.
      Sometimes they bear the forms of Egyptian gods, as Horus, or Thoth, or
      Anubis;<a href="#linknote-7115" name="linknoteref-7115"       id="linknoteref-7115">7115</a> sometimes cartouches with the names of
      kings as Menkara, Thothmes III., Amenophis III., Seti I., &amp;c.;<a
      href="#linknote-7116" name="linknoteref-7116" id="linknoteref-7116">7116</a>
      sometimes mere sacred emblems, as the winged uræus, the disk between two
      uræi,<a href="#linknote-7117" name="linknoteref-7117" id="linknoteref-7117">7117</a>
      and the like. Occasionally there is the representation of a scene with
      which the Egyptian bas-reliefs have made us familiar:<a
      href="#linknote-7118" name="linknoteref-7118" id="linknoteref-7118">7118</a>
      a warrior has caught hold of his vanquished and kneeling enemy by a lock
      of his hair, and threatens him with an axe or mace, which he brandishes
      above his head. Or a lion takes the place of the captive man, and is
      menaced in the same way. Human figures struggling with lions, and lions
      killing wild bulls, are also common;<a href="#linknote-7119"       name="linknoteref-7119" id="linknoteref-7119">7119</a> but the type in
      these cases is less Egyptian than Oriental.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phoenician painting was not, like Egyptian, displayed upon the walls of
      temples, nor was it, like Greek, the production of actual pictures for the
      decoration of houses. It was employed to a certain extent on statues, not
      so as to cover the entire figure, but with delicacy and discretion, for
      the marking out of certain details, and the emphasising of certain parts
      of the design.<a href="#linknote-7120" name="linknoteref-7120"       id="linknoteref-7120">7120</a> The hair and beard were often painted a
      brownish red; the pupil of the eye was marked by means of colour; and
      robes had often a border of red or blue. Statuettes were tinted more
      generally, whole vestments being sometimes coloured red or green,<a
      href="#linknote-7121" name="linknoteref-7121" id="linknoteref-7121">7121</a>
      and a gay effect being produced, which is said to be agreeable and
      harmonious.<a href="#linknote-7122" name="linknoteref-7122"       id="linknoteref-7122">7122</a> But the nearest approach to painting proper
      which was made by the Phoenicians was upon their vessels in clay, in
      terra-cotta, and in alabaster. Here, though, the ornamentation was
      sometimes merely by patterns or bands,<a href="#linknote-7123"       name="linknoteref-7123" id="linknoteref-7123">7123</a> there were
      occasionally real attempts to depict animal and human forms, which, if not
      very successful, still possess considerable interest. The noble amphora
      from Curium, figured by Di Cesnola,<a href="#linknote-7124"       name="linknoteref-7124" id="linknoteref-7124">7124</a> contains above
      forty representations of horses, and nearly as many of birds. The shape of
      the horse is exceedingly conventional, the whole form being attenuated in
      the highest degree; but the animal is drawn with spirit, and the departure
      from nature is clearly intentional. In the animals that are pasturing, the
      general attitude is well seized; the movement is exactly that of the horse
      when he stretches his neck to reach and crop the grass.<a
      href="#linknote-7125" name="linknoteref-7125" id="linknoteref-7125">7125</a>
      In the birds there is equal spirit and greater truth to nature: they are
      in various attitudes, preening their feathers, pecking the ground,
      standing with head erect in the usual way. Other vases contain figures of
      cows, goats, stags, fish and birds of various kinds, while one has an
      attempt at a hippopotamus. The attempts to represent the human form are
      certainly not happy; they remind us of the more ambitious efforts of
      Chinese and Japanese art.

    <p>
      Phoenicia was celebrated from a remote antiquity for the manufacture of
      textile fabrics. The materials which she employed for them were wool,
      linen yarn, perhaps cotton, and, in the later period of her commercial
      prosperity, silk. The &ldquo;white wool&rdquo; of Syria was supplied to her in
      abundance by the merchants of Damascus,<a href="#linknote-81"
       name="linknoteref-81" id="linknoteref-81">81</a> and wool of lambs, rams,
      and goats seems also to have been furnished by the more distant parts of
      Arabia.<a href="#linknote-82" name="linknoteref-82" id="linknoteref-82">82</a>
      Linen yarn may have been imported from Egypt, where it was largely
      manufactured, and was of excellent quality;<a href="#linknote-83"
       name="linknoteref-83" id="linknoteref-83">83</a> while raw silk is said to
      have been &ldquo;brought to Tyre and Berytus by the Persian merchants, and there
      both dyed and woven into cloaks."<a href="#linknote-84"
       name="linknoteref-84" id="linknoteref-84">84</a> The price of silk was
      very high, and it was customary in Phoenicia to intermix the precious
      material either with linen or with cotton;<a href="#linknote-85"
       name="linknoteref-85" id="linknoteref-85">85</a> as is still done to a
      certain extent in modern times. It is perhaps doubtful whether, so far as
      the mere fabric of stuffs was concerned, the products of the Phoenician
      looms were at all superior to those which Egypt and Babylonia furnished,
      much less to those which came from India, and passed under the name of <i>Sindones</i>.
      Two things gave to the Phoenician stuffs that high reputation which caused
      them to be more sought for than any others; and these were, first, the
      brilliancy and beauty of their colours, and, secondly, the delicacy with
      which they were in many instances embroidered. We have not much trace of
      Phoenician embroidery on the representations of dresses that have come
      down to us; but the testimony of the ancients is unimpeachable,<a
      href="#linknote-86" name="linknoteref-86" id="linknoteref-86">86</a> and
      we may regard it as certain that the art of embroidery, known at a very
      early date to the Hebrews,<a href="#linknote-87" name="linknoteref-87"
       id="linknoteref-87">87</a> was cultivated with great success by their
      Phoenician neighbours, and under their auspices reached a high point of
      perfection. The character of the decoration is to be gathered from the
      extant statues and bas-reliefs, from the representations on pateræ, on
      cups, dishes, and gems. There was a tendency to divide the surface to be
      ornamented into parallel stripes or bands, and to repeat along the line a
      single object, or two alternately. Rosettes, monsters of various kinds,
      winged globes with uræi, scarabs, sacred trees, and garlands or blossoms
      of the lotus were the ordinary &ldquo;motives."<a href="#linknote-88"
       name="linknoteref-88" id="linknoteref-88">88</a> Occasionally human
      figures might be introduced, and animal forms even more frequently; but a
      stiff conventionalism prevailed, the same figures were constantly
      repeated, and the figures themselves had in few cases much beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brilliancy and beauty of the Phoenician coloured stuffs resulted from
      the excellency of their dyes. Here we touch a second branch of their
      industrial skill, for the principal dyes used were originally invented and
      continuously fabricated by the Phoenicians themselves, not imported from
      any foreign country. Nature had placed along the Phoenician coast, or at
      any rate along a great portion of it, an inexhaustible supply of certain
      shell-fish, or molluscs, which contained as a part of their internal
      economy a colouring fluid possessing remarkable, and indeed unique,
      qualities. Some account has been already given of the species which are
      thought to have been anciently most esteemed. They belong, mainly, to the
      two allied families of the <i>Murex</i> and the <i>Buccinum</i> or <i>Purpura</i>.
      Eight species of the former, and six of the latter, having their habitat
      in the Mediterranean, have been distinguished by some naturalists;<a
      href="#linknote-89" name="linknoteref-89" id="linknoteref-89">89</a> but
      two of the former only, and one of the latter, appear to have attracted
      the attention of the Phoenicians. The <i>Murex brandaris</i> is now
      thought to have borne away the palm from all the others; it is extremely
      common upon the coast; and enormous heaps of the shells are found,
      especially in the vicinity of Tyre, crushed and broken&mdash;the débris,
      as it would seem, cast away by the manufacturers of old.<a
      href="#linknote-810" name="linknoteref-810" id="linknoteref-810">810</a>
      The <i>Murex trunculus</i>, according to some, is just as abundant, in a
      crushed state, in the vicinity of Sidon, great banks of it existing, which
      are a hundred yards long and several yards thick.<a href="#linknote-811"
       name="linknoteref-811" id="linknoteref-811">811</a> It is a more spinous
      shell than the <i>M. brandaris</i>, having numerous projecting points, and
      a generally rough and rugged appearance. The <i>Purpura</i> employed seems
      to have been the <i>P. lapillus</i>, a mollusc not confined to the
      Mediterranean, but one which frequents also our own shores, and was once
      turned to some account in Ireland.<a href="#linknote-812"
       name="linknoteref-812" id="linknoteref-812">812</a> The varieties of the
      <i>P. lapillus</i> differ considerably. Some are nearly white, some
      greyish, others buff striped with brown. Some, again, are smooth, others
      nearly as rough as the <i>Murex trunculus</i>. The <i>Helix ianthina</i>,
      which is included by certain writers among the molluscs employed for
      dyeing purposes by the Phoenicians,<a href="#linknote-813"
       name="linknoteref-813" id="linknoteref-813">813</a> is a shell of a
      completely different character, smooth and delicate, much resembling that
      of an ordinary land snail, and small compared to the others. It is not
      certain, however, that the <i>helix</i>, though abounding in the Eastern
      Mediterranean,<a href="#linknote-814" name="linknoteref-814"
       id="linknoteref-814">814</a> ever attracted the notice of the Phoenicians.
    </p>
    <p>
      The molluscs needed by the Phoenician dyers were not obtained without some
      difficulty. As the Mediterranean has no tides, it does not uncover its
      shores at low water like the ocean, or invite man to rifle them. The
      coveted shell-fish, in most instances, preferred tolerably deep water; and
      to procure them in any quantity it was necessary that they should be
      fished up from a depth of some fathoms. The mode in which they were
      captured was the following. A long rope was let down into the sea, with
      baskets of reeds or rushes attached to it at intervals, constructed like
      our lobster-traps or eel-baskets, with an opening that yielded easily to
      pressure from the outside, but resisted pressure from the inside, and made
      escape, when once the trap was entered, impossible. The baskets were
      baited with mussels or frogs, both of which had great attractions for the
      <i>Purpuræ</i>, and were seized and devoured with avidity. At the upper
      end of the rope was attached to a large piece of cork, which, even when
      the baskets were full, could not be drawn under water. It was usual to set
      the traps in the evening, and after waiting a night, or sometimes a night
      and a day, to draw them up to the surface, when they were generally found
      to be full of the coveted shell-fish.<a href="#linknote-815"
       name="linknoteref-815" id="linknoteref-815">815</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two ways in which the dye was obtained from the molluscs.
      Sometimes a hole was broken in the side of the shell, and the fish taken
      out entire.<a href="#linknote-816" name="linknoteref-816"
       id="linknoteref-816">816</a> The <i>sac</i> containing the colouring
      matter, which is a sort of vein, beginning at the head of the animal, and
      following the tortuous line of the body as it twists through the spiral
      shell,<a href="#linknote-817" name="linknoteref-817" id="linknoteref-817">817</a>
      was then carefully extracted, either while the mollusc was still alive, or
      as soon as possible after death, as otherwise the quality of the dye was
      impaired. This plan was pursued more especially with the larger species of
      <i>Purpuræ</i>, where the <i>sac</i> attained a certain size; while with a
      smaller kinds a different method was followed. In their case no attempt
      was made to extract the <i>sac</i>, but the entire fish was crushed,
      together with its shell, and after salt had been added in the proportion
      of twenty ounces to a hundred pounds of the pulp, three days were allowed
      for maceration; heat was then applied, and when, by repeated skimming, the
      coarse particles had been removed, the dye was left in a liquid state at
      the bottom. It was necessary that the vessel in which this final process
      took place should be of lead, and not of bronze or iron, since those
      metals gave the dye a disagreeable tinge.<a href="#linknote-818"
       name="linknoteref-818" id="linknoteref-818">818</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The colouring matter contained in the <i>sac</i> of the <i>Purpuræ</i> is
      a liquid of a creamy consistency, and of a yellowish-white hue. On
      extraction, it is at first decidedly yellow; then after a little time it
      becomes green; and, finally, it settles into some shade of violet or
      purple. Chemical analysis has shown that in the case of the <i>Murex
      trunculus</i> the liquid is composed of two elementary substances, one
      being cyanic acid, which is of a blue or azure colour, and the other being
      purpuric oxide, which is a bright red.<a href="#linknote-819"
       name="linknoteref-819" id="linknoteref-819">819</a> In the case of the <i>Murex
      brandaris</i> one element only has been found: it is an oxide, which has
      received the name of <i>oxyde tyrien</i>.<a href="#linknote-820"
       name="linknoteref-820" id="linknoteref-820">820</a> No naturalist has as
      yet discovered what purpose the liquid serves in the economy, or in the
      preservation, of the animal; it is certainly not exuded, as sepia is by
      the cuttle-fish, to cloud the water in the neighbourhood, and enable the
      creature to conceal itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning the Phoenician process of dyeing, the accounts which have come
      down to us are at once confused and incomplete. Nothing is said with
      respect to their employment of mordants, either acid or alkali, and yet it
      is almost certain that they must have used one or the other, or both, to
      fix the colours, and render them permanent. The <i>gamins</i> of Tyre
      employ to this day mordants of each sort;<a href="#linknote-821"
       name="linknoteref-821" id="linknoteref-821">821</a> and an alkali derived
      from seaweed is mentioned by Pliny as made use of for fixing some dyes,<a
      href="#linknote-822" name="linknoteref-822" id="linknoteref-822">822</a>
      though he does not distinctly tell us that it was known to the Phoenicians
      or employed in fixing the purple. What we chiefly learn from this writer
      as to the dyeing process is<a href="#linknote-823" name="linknoteref-823"
       id="linknoteref-823">823</a>&mdash;first, that sometimes the liquid
      derived from the <i>murex</i> only, sometimes that of the <i>purpura</i>
      or <i>buccinum</i> only, was applied to the material which it was wished
      to colour, while the most approved hue was produced by an application of
      both dyes separately. Secondly, we are told that the material, whatever it
      might be, was steeped in the dye for a certain number of hours, then
      withdrawn for a while, and afterwards returned to the vat and steeped a
      second time. The best Tyrian cloths were called <i>Dibapha</i>, i.e.
      &ldquo;twice dipped;&rdquo; and for the production of the true &ldquo;Tyrian purple&rdquo; it was
      necessary that the dye obtained from the <i>Buccinum</i> should be used
      after that from the <i>Murex</i> had been applied. The <i>Murex</i> alone
      gave a dye that was firm, and reckoned moderately good; but the <i>Buccinum</i>
      alone was weak, and easily washed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The actual tints produced from the shell-fish appear to have ranged from
      blue, through violet and purple, to crimson and rose.<a
      href="#linknote-824" name="linknoteref-824" id="linknoteref-824">824</a>
      Scarlet could not be obtained, but was yielded by the cochineal insect.
      Even for the brighter sorts of crimson some admixture of the cochineal dye
      was necessary.<a href="#linknote-825" name="linknoteref-825"
       id="linknoteref-825">825</a> The violet tint was not generally greatly
      prized, though there was a period in the reign of Augustus when it was the
      fashion;<a href="#linknote-826" name="linknoteref-826" id="linknoteref-826">826</a>
      redder hues were commonly preferred; and the choicest of all is described
      as &ldquo;a rich, dark purple, the colour of coagulated blood."<a
      href="#linknote-827" name="linknoteref-827" id="linknoteref-827">827</a> A
      deep crimson was also in request, and seems frequently to be intended when
      the term purple ({porphureos}, <i>purpureus</i>) is used.
    </p>
    <p>
      A third industry greatly affected by the Phoenicians was the manufacture
      of glass. According to Pliny,<a href="#linknote-828" name="linknoteref-828"
       id="linknoteref-828">828</a> the first discovery of the substance was made
      upon the Phoenician coast by a body of sailors whom he no doubt regarded
      as Phoenicians. These persons had brought a cargo of natrum, which is the
      subcarbonate of soda, to the Syrian coast in the vicinity of Acre, and had
      gone ashore at the mouth of the river Belus to cook their dinner. Having
      lighted a fire upon the sand, they looked about for some stones to prop up
      their cooking utensils, but finding none, or none convenient for the
      purpose, they bethought themselves of utilising for the occasion some of
      the blocks of natrum with which their ship was laden. These were placed
      close to the fire, and the heat was sufficient to melt a portion of one of
      them, which, mixing with the siliceous sand at its base, produced a stream
      of glass. There is nothing impossible or even very improbable in this
      story; but we may question whether the scene of it is rightly placed.
      Glass was manufactured in Egypt many centuries before the probable date of
      the Phoenician occupation of the Mediterranean coast; and, if the honour
      of the invention is to be assigned to a particular people, the Egyptians
      would seem to have the best claim to it. The process of glass-blowing is
      represented in tombs at Beni Hassan of very great antiquity,<a
      href="#linknote-829" name="linknoteref-829" id="linknoteref-829">829</a>
      and a specimen of Egyptian glass is in existence bearing the name of a
      Usurtasen, a king of the twelfth dynasty.<a href="#linknote-830"
       name="linknoteref-830" id="linknoteref-830">830</a> Natrum, moreover, was
      an Egyptian product, well known from a remote date, being the chief
      ingredient used in the various processes of embalming.<a
      href="#linknote-831" name="linknoteref-831" id="linknoteref-831">831</a>
      Phoenicia has no natrum, and not even any vegetable alkali readily
      procurable in considerable quantity. There <i>may have been</i> an
      accidental discovery of glass in Phoenicia, but priority of discovery
      belonged almost certainly to Egypt; and it is, upon the whole, most
      probable that Phoenicia derived from Egypt her knowledge both of the
      substance itself and of the method of making it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, there can be no doubt that the manufacture was one on which the
      Phoenicians eagerly seized, and which they carried out on a large scale
      and very successfully. Sidon, according to the ancients,<a
      href="#linknote-832" name="linknoteref-832" id="linknoteref-832">832</a>
      was the chief seat of the industry; but the best sand is found near Tyre,
      and both Tyre and Sarepta also seem to have been among the places where
      glassworks were early established. At Sarepta extensive banks of <i>débris</i>
      have been found, consisting of broken glass of many colours, the waste
      beyond all doubt of a great glass manufactory;<a href="#linknote-833"
       name="linknoteref-833" id="linknoteref-833">833</a> at Tyre, the traces of
      the industry are less extensive,<a href="#linknote-834"
       name="linknoteref-834" id="linknoteref-834">834</a> but on the other hand
      we have historical evidence that it continued to be practised there into
      the middle ages.<a href="#linknote-835" name="linknoteref-835"
       id="linknoteref-835">835</a>

      The glass produced by the Phoenicians was of three kinds: first,
      transparent colourless glass, which the eye could see through; secondly,
      translucent coloured glass, through which light could pass, though the eye
      could not penetrate it so as to distinguish objects; and, thirdly, opaque
      glass, scarcely distinguishable from porcelain. Transparent glass was
      employed for mirrors, round plates being cast, which made very tolerable
      looking-glasses,<a href="#linknote-836" name="linknoteref-836"
       id="linknoteref-836">836</a> when covered at the back by thin sheets of
      metal, and also for common objects, such as vases, urns, bottles, and
      jugs, which have been yielded in abundance by tombs of a somewhat late
      date in Cyprus.<a href="#linknote-837" name="linknoteref-837"
       id="linknoteref-837">837</a> No great store, however, seems to have been
      set upon transparency, in which the Oriental eye saw no beauty; and the
      objects which modern research has recovered under this head at Tyre, in
      Cyprus, and elsewhere, seem the work of comparatively rude artists, and
      have little æsthetic merit. The shapes, however, are not inelegant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most beautiful of the objects in glass produced by the Phoenicians are
      the translucent or semi-transparent vessels of different kinds, most of
      them variously coloured, which have been found in Cyprus, at Camirus in
      Rhodes, and on the Syrian coast, near Beyrout and elsewhere.<a
      href="#linknote-838" name="linknoteref-838" id="linknoteref-838">838</a>
      These comprise small flasks or bottles, from three to six inches long,
      probably intended to contain perfumes; small jugs (oenochoæ) from three
      inches in height to five inches; vases of about the same size; amphoræ
      pointed at the lower extremity; and other varieties. They are coloured,
      generally, either in longitudinal or in horizontal stripes and bands; but
      the bands often deviate from the straight line into zig-zags, which are
      always more or less irregular, like the zig-zags of the Norman builders,
      while sometimes they are deflected into crescents, or other curves, as
      particularly one resembling a willow-leaf. The colours are not very vivid,
      but are pleasing and well-contrasted; they are chiefly five&mdash;white,
      blue, yellow, green, and a purplish brown. Red scarcely appears, except in
      a very pale, pinkish form; and even in this form it is uncommon. Blue, on
      the other hand, is greatly affected, being sometimes used in the patterns,
      often taken for the ground, and occasionally, in two tints, forming both
      groundwork and ornamentation.<a href="#linknote-839" name="linknoteref-839"
       id="linknoteref-839">839</a> It is not often that more than three hues are
      found on the same vessel, and sometimes the hues employed are only two.
      There are instances, however, and very admirable instances, of the
      employment, on a single vessel, of four hues.<a href="#linknote-840"
       name="linknoteref-840" id="linknoteref-840">840</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The colours were obtained, commonly, at any rate, from metallic oxides.
      The ordinary blue employed is cobalt, though it is suspected that there
      was an occasional use of copper. Copper certainly furnished the greens,
      while manganese gave the brown, which shades off into purple and into
      black. The beautiful milky white which forms the ground tint of some vases
      is believed to have been derived from the oxide of tin, or else from
      phosphate of chalk. It is said that the colouring matter of the patterns
      does not extend through the entire thickness of the glass, but lies only
      on the outer surface, being a later addition to the vessels as first made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Translucent coloured glass was also largely produced by the Phoenicians
      for beads and other ornaments, and also for the imitation of gems. The
      huge emerald of which Herodotus speaks,<a href="#linknote-841"
       name="linknoteref-841" id="linknoteref-841">841</a> as &ldquo;shining with great
      brilliancy at night&rdquo; in the temple of Melkarth at Tyre, was probably a
      glass cylinder, into which a lamb was introduced by the priests. In
      Phoenician times the pretended stone is quite as often a glass paste as a
      real gem, and the case is the same with the scarabs so largely used as
      seals. In Phoenician necklaces, glass beads alternate frequently with real
      agates, onyxes, and crystals; while sometimes glass in various shapes is
      the only material employed. A necklace found at Tharros in Sardinia, and
      now in the collection of the Louvre, which is believed to be of Phoenician
      manufacture, is composed of above forty beads, two cylinders, four
      pendants representing heads of bulls, and one representing the face of a
      man, all of glass.<a href="#linknote-842" name="linknoteref-842"
       id="linknoteref-842">842</a> Another, found by M. Renan in Phoenicia
      itself, is made up of glass beads imitating pearls, intermixed with beads
      of cornaline and agate.<a href="#linknote-843" name="linknoteref-843"
       id="linknoteref-843">843</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Another class of glass ornaments consists of small flat <i>plaques</i> or
      plates, pierced with a number of fine holes, which appear to have been
      sewn upon garments. These are usually patterned, sometimes with spirals,
      sometimes with rosettes, occasionally, though rarely, with figures.
      Messrs. Perrot and Chipiez represent one in their great work upon ancient
      art,<a href="#linknote-844" name="linknoteref-844" id="linknoteref-844">844</a>
      where almost the entire field is occupied by a winged griffin, standing
      upright on its two hind legs, and crowned with a striped cap, or turban.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phoenician opaque glass is comparatively rare, and possesses but little
      beauty. It was rendered opaque in various ways. Messrs. Perrot and Chipiez
      found that in a statue of Serapis, which they analysed, the glass was
      mixed with bronze in the proportions of ten to three. An opaque material
      of a handsome red colour was thus produced, which was heavy and
      exceedingly hard.<a href="#linknote-845" name="linknoteref-845"
       id="linknoteref-845">845</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The methods pursued by the Phoenician glass-manufacturers were probably
      much the same as those which are still employed for the production of
      similar objects, and involved the use of similar implements, as the
      blowpipe, the lathe, and the graver. The materials having been procured,
      they were fused together in a crucible or melting-pot by the heat of a
      powerful furnace. A blowpipe was then introduced into the viscous mass, a
      portion of which readily attached itself to the implement, and so much
      glass was withdrawn as was deemed sufficient for the object which it was
      designed to manufacture. The blower then set to work, and blew hard into
      the pipe until the glass at its lower extremity began to expand and
      gradually took a pear-shaped form, the material partially coolling and
      hardening, but still retaining a good deal of softness and pliability.
      While in this condition, it was detached from the pipe, and modelled with
      pincers or with the hand into the shape required, after which it was
      polished, and perhaps sometimes cut by means of the turning-lathe. Sand
      and emery were the chief polishers, and by their help a surface was
      produced, with which little fault could be found, being smooth, uniform,
      and brilliant. Thus the vessel was formed, and if no further ornament was
      required, the manufacture was complete&mdash;a jug, vase, alabastron,
      amphora, was produced, either transparent or of a single uniform tint,
      which might be white, blue, brown, green, &amp;c., according to the
      particular oxide which had been thrown, with the silica and alkali, into
      the crucible. Generally, however, the manufacturer was not content with so
      simple a product: he aimed not merely at utility, but at beauty, and
      proceeded to adorn the work of his hands&mdash;whatever it was&mdash;with
      patterns which were for the most part in good taste and highly pleasing.
      These patterns he first scratched on the outer surface of the vessel with
      a graving tool; then, when he had made his depressions deep enough, he
      took threads of coloured glass, and having filled up with the threads the
      depressions which he had made, he subjected the vessel once more to such a
      heat that the threads were fused, and attached themselves to the ground on
      which they had been laid. In melting they would generally more than fill
      the cavities, overflowing them, and protruding from them, whence it was
      for the most part necessary to repeat the polishing process, and to bring
      by means of abrasion the entire surface once more into uniformity. There
      are cases where this has been incompletely done and where the patterns
      project; there are others where the threads have never thoroughly melted
      into the ground, and where in the course of time they have partially
      detached themselves from it; but in general the fusion and subsequent
      polishing have been all that could be wished, and the patterns are
      perfectly level with the ground and seem one with it.<a
      href="#linknote-846" name="linknoteref-846" id="linknoteref-846">846</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The running of liquid glass into moulds, so common nowadays, does not seem
      to have been practised by the Phoenicians, perhaps because their furnaces
      were not sufficiently hot to produce complete liquefaction. But&mdash;if
      this was so&mdash;the pressure of the viscous material into moulds cannot
      have been unknown, since we have evidence of the existence of moulds,<a
      href="#linknote-847" name="linknoteref-847" id="linknoteref-847">847</a>
      and there are cases where several specimens of an object have evidently
      issued from a single matrix.<a href="#linknote-848" name="linknoteref-848"
       id="linknoteref-848">848</a> Beads, cylinders, pendants, scarabs, amulets,
      were probably, all of them, made in this way, sometimes in translucent,
      sometimes in semi-opaque glass, as perhaps were also the <i>plaques</i>
      which have been already described.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ceramic art of the Phoenicians is not very remarkable. Phoenicia
      Proper is deficient in clay of a superior character, and it was probably a
      very ordinary and coarse kind of pottery that the Phoenician merchants of
      early times exported regularly in their trading voyages, both inside and
      outside the Mediterranean. We hear of their carrying this cheap
      earthenware northwards to the Cassiterides or Scilly Islands,<a
      href="#linknote-849" name="linknoteref-849" id="linknoteref-849">849</a>
      and southwards to the isle of Cerné, which is probably Arguin, on the West
      African coast;<a href="#linknote-850" name="linknoteref-850"
       id="linknoteref-850">850</a> nor can we doubt that they supplied it also
      to the uncivilised races of the Mediterranean&mdash;the Illyrians,
      Ligurians, Sicels, Sards, Corsicans, Spaniards, Libyans. But the fragile
      nature of the material, and its slight value, have caused its entire
      disappearance in the course of centuries, unless in the shape of small
      fragments; nor are these fragments readily distinguishable from those
      whose origin is different. Phoenicia Proper has furnished no earthen
      vessels, either whole or in pieces, that can be assigned to a time earlier
      than the Greco-Roman period,<a href="#linknote-851" name="linknoteref-851"
       id="linknoteref-851">851</a> nor have any such vessels been found hitherto
      on Phoenician sites either in Sardinia, or in Corsica, or in Spain, or
      Africa, or Sicily, or Malta, or Gozzo. The only places that have hitherto
      furnished earthen vases or other vessels presumably Phoenician are
      Jerusalem, Camirus in Rhodes, and Cyprus; and it is from the specimens
      found at these sites that we must form our estimate of the Phoenician
      pottery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The earliest specimens are of a moderately good clay, unglazed. They are
      regular in shape, being made by the help of a wheel, and for the most part
      not inelegant, though they cannot be said to possess any remarkable
      beauty. Many are without ornament of any kind, being apparently mere jars,
      used for the storing away of oil or wine; they have sometimes painted or
      scratched upon them, in Phoenician characters, the name of the maker or
      owner. A few rise somewhat above the ordinary level, having handles of
      some elegance, and being painted with designs and patterns, generally of a
      geometrical character. A vase about six inches high, found at Jerusalem,
      has, between horizontal bands, a series of geometric patterns, squares,
      octagons, lozenges, triangles, pleasingly arranged, and painted in brown
      upon a ground which is of a dull grey. At the top are two rude handles,
      between which runs a line of zig-zag, while at the bottom is a sort of
      stand or base. The shape is heavy and inelegant.<a href="#linknote-852"
       name="linknoteref-852" id="linknoteref-852">852</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Another vase of a similar character to this, but superior in many
      respects, was found by General Di Cesnola at Dali (Idalium), and is
      figured in his &ldquo;Cyprus."<a href="#linknote-853" name="linknoteref-853"
       id="linknoteref-853">853</a> This vase has the shape of an urn, and is
      ornamented with horizontal bands, except towards the middle, where it has
      its greatest diameter, and exhibits a series of geometric designs. In the
      centre is a lozenge, divided into four smaller lozenges by a St. Andrew&rsquo;s
      cross; other compartments are triangular, and are filled with a chequer of
      black and white, resembling the squares of a chessboard. Beyond, on either
      side, are vertical bands, diversified with a lozenge ornament. Two hands
      succeed, of a shape that is thought to have &ldquo;a certain elegance."<a
      href="#linknote-854" name="linknoteref-854" id="linknoteref-854">854</a>
      There is a rim, which might receive a cover, at top, and at bottom a short
      pedestal. The height of the vase is about thirteen inches.
    </p>
    <p>
      In many of the Cyprian vases having a geometric decoration, the figures
      are not painted on the surface but impressed or incised. Messrs. Perrot
      and Chipiez regard this form of ornamentation as the earliest; but the
      beauty and finish of several vases on which it occurs is against the
      supposition. There is scarcely to be found, even in the range of Greek
      art, a more elegant form than that of the jug in black clay brought by
      General Di Cesnola from Alambra and figured both in his &ldquo;Cyprus"<a
      href="#linknote-855" name="linknoteref-855" id="linknoteref-855">855</a>
      and in the &ldquo;Histoire de l&rsquo;Art."<a href="#linknote-856"
       name="linknoteref-856" id="linknoteref-856">856</a> Yet its ornamentation
      is incised. If, then, incised patterning preceded painted in Phoenicia, at
      any rate it held its ground after painting was introduced, and continued
      in vogue even to the time when Greek taste had largely influenced
      Phoenician art of every description.
    </p>
    <p>
      The finest Phoenician efforts in ceramic art resemble either the best
      Egyptian or the best Greek. As the art advanced, the advantage of a rich
      glaze was appreciated, and specimens which seem to be Phoenician have all
      the delicacy and beauty of the best Egyptian faïence. A cup found at
      Idalium, plain on the outside, is covered internally with a green enamel,
      on which are patterns and designs in black.<a href="#linknote-857"
       name="linknoteref-857" id="linknoteref-857">857</a> In a medallion at the
      bottom of the cup is the representation of a marshy tract overgrown with
      the papyrus plant, whereof we see both the leaves and blossoms, while
      among them, rushing at full speed, is the form of a wild boar. The rest of
      the ornamentation consists chiefly of concentric circles; but between two
      of the circles is left a tolerably broad ring, which has a pattern
      consisting of a series of broadish leaves pointing towards the cup&rsquo;s
      centre. Nothing can be more delicate, or in better taste, than the entire
      design.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most splendid of all the Cyprian vases was found at Curium, and has
      been already represented in this volume. It is an amphora of large
      dimensions, ornamented in part with geometrical designs, in part with
      compartments, in which are represented horses and birds. The form, the
      designs, and the general physiognomy of the amphora are considered to be
      in close accordance with Athenian vases of the most antique school. The
      resemblance is so great that some have supposed the vase to have been an
      importation from Attica into Cyprus;<a href="#linknote-858"
       name="linknoteref-858" id="linknoteref-858">858</a> but such conjectures
      are always hazardous; and the principal motives of the design are so
      frequent on the Cyprian vases, that the native origin of the vessel is at
      least possible, and the judgment of some of the best critics seems to
      incline in this direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, on the whole, the Cyprian ceramic art is somewhat disappointing.
      What is original in it is either grotesque, as the vases in the shape of
      animals,<a href="#linknote-859" name="linknoteref-859" id="linknoteref-859">859</a>
      or those crowned by human heads,<a href="#linknote-860"
       name="linknoteref-860" id="linknoteref-860">860</a> or those again which
      have for spout a female figure pouring liquid out of a jug.<a
      href="#linknote-861" name="linknoteref-861" id="linknoteref-861">861</a>
      What is superior has the appearance of having been borrowed. Egyptian,
      Assyrian, and Greek art, each in turn, furnished shapes, designs, and
      patterns to the Phoenician potters, who readily adopted from any and every
      quarter the forms and decorations which hit their fancy. Their fancy was,
      predominantly, for the <i>bizarre</i> and the extravagant. Vases in the
      shape of helmets, in the shape of barrels, in the shape of human heads,<a
      href="#linknote-862" name="linknoteref-862" id="linknoteref-862">862</a>
      have little fitness, and in the Cyprian specimens have little beauty; the
      mixture of Assyrian with Egyptian forms is incongruous; the birds and
      beasts represented are drawn with studied quaintness, a quaintness
      recalling the art of China and Japan. If there is elegance in some of the
      forms, it is seldom a very pronounced elegance; and, where the taste is
      best, the suspicion continually arises that a foreign model has been
      imitated. Moreover, from first to last the art makes little progress.
      There seems to have been an arrest of development.<a href="#linknote-863"
       name="linknoteref-863" id="linknoteref-863">863</a> The early steps are
      taken, but at a certain point stagnation sets in; there is no further
      attempt to improve or advance; the artists are content to repeat
      themselves, and reproduce the patterns of the past. Perhaps there was no
      demand for ceramic art of a higher order. At any rate, progress ceases,
      and while Greece was rising to her grandest efforts, Cyprus, and Phoenicia
      generally, were content to remain stationary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides their ornamental metallurgy, which has been treated of in a former
      chapter, the Phoenicians largely employed several metals, especially
      bronze and copper, in the fabrication of vessels for ordinary use, of
      implements, arms, toilet articles, furniture, &amp;c. The vessels include
      pateræ, bowls, jugs, amphoræ, and cups;<a href="#linknote-864"
       name="linknoteref-864" id="linknoteref-864">864</a> the implements,
      hatchets, adzes, knives, and sickles;<a href="#linknote-865"
       name="linknoteref-865" id="linknoteref-865">865</a> the arms, spearheads,
      arrowheads, daggers, battle-axes, helmets, and shields;<a
      href="#linknote-866" name="linknoteref-866" id="linknoteref-866">866</a>
      the toilet articles, mirrors, hand-bells, buckles, candlesticks, &amp;c.;<a
      href="#linknote-867" name="linknoteref-867" id="linknoteref-867">867</a>
      the furniture, tall candelabra, tripods, and thrones.<a
      href="#linknote-868" name="linknoteref-868" id="linknoteref-868">868</a>
      The bronze is of an excellent quality, having generally about nine parts
      of copper to one of tin; and there is reason to believe that by the
      skilful tempering of the Phoenician metallurgists, it attained a hardness
      which was not often given it by others. The Cyprian shields were
      remarkable. They were of a round shape, slightly convex, and instead of
      the ordinary boss, had a long projecting cone in the centre. An actual
      shield, with the cone perfect, was found by General Di Cesnola at Amathus,<a
      href="#linknote-869" name="linknoteref-869" id="linknoteref-869">869</a>
      and a projection of the same kind is seen in several of the Sardinian
      bronze and terra-cotta statuettes.<a href="#linknote-870"
       name="linknoteref-870" id="linknoteref-870">870</a> Shields were sometimes
      elaborately embossed, in part with patterning, in part with animal and
      vegetable forms.<a href="#linknote-871" name="linknoteref-871"
       id="linknoteref-871">871</a> Helmets were also embossed with care, and
      sometimes inscribed with the name of the maker or the owner.<a
      href="#linknote-872" name="linknoteref-872" id="linknoteref-872">872</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Some remains of swords, probably Phoenician, have been found in Sardinia.
      They vary from two feet seven inches to four feet two inches in length.<a
      href="#linknote-873" name="linknoteref-873" id="linknoteref-873">873</a>
      The blade is commonly straight, and very thick in the centre, but tapers
      off on both sides to a sharp edge. The point is blunt, so that the
      intention cannot have been to use the weapon both for cutting and
      thrusting, but only for the former. It would scarcely make such a clean
      cut as a modern broadsword, but would no doubt be equally effectual for
      killing or disabling. Another weapon, found in Sardinia, and sometimes
      called a sword, is more properly a knife or dagger. In length it does not
      exceed seven or eight inches, and of this length more than a third is
      occupied by the handle.<a href="#linknote-874" name="linknoteref-874"
       id="linknoteref-874">874</a> Below the handle the blade broadens for about
      an inch or an inch and a half; after this it contracts, and tapers gently
      to a sharp point. Such a weapon appears sometimes in the hand of a
      statuette.<a href="#linknote-875" name="linknoteref-875"
       id="linknoteref-875">875</a>

      The bronze articles of the toilet recovered by recent researches in Cyprus
      and elsewhere are remarkable. The handle of a mirror found in Cyprus, and
      now in the Museum of New York, possesses considerable merit. It consists
      mainly of a female figure, naked, and standing upon a frog.<a
      href="#linknote-876" name="linknoteref-876" id="linknoteref-876">876</a>
      In her hands she holds a pair of cymbals, which she is in the act of
      striking together. A ribbon, passed over her left shoulder, is carried
      through a ring, from which hangs a seal. On her arms and shoulders appear
      to have stood two lions, which formed side supports to the mirror that was
      attached to the figure&rsquo;s head. If the face of the cymbal-player cannot
      boast of much beauty, and her figure is thought to &ldquo;lack distinction,&rdquo;
       still it is granted that the <i>tout ensemble</i> of the work was not
      without originality, and may have possessed a certain amount of elegance.<a
      href="#linknote-877" name="linknoteref-877" id="linknoteref-877">877</a>
      The frog is particularly well modelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some candlesticks found in the Treasury of Curium,<a href="#linknote-878"
       name="linknoteref-878" id="linknoteref-878">878</a> and a tripod from the
      same place, seem to deserve a short notice. The candlesticks stand upon a
      sort of short pillar as a base, above which is the blossom of a flower
      inverted, a favourite Phoenician ornament.<a href="#linknote-879"
       name="linknoteref-879" id="linknoteref-879">879</a> From this rises the
      lamp-stand, composed of three leaves, which curl outwards, and support
      between them a ring into which the bottom of the lamp fitted. The tripod<a
      href="#linknote-880" name="linknoteref-880" id="linknoteref-880">880</a>
      is more elaborate. The legs, which are fluted, bulge considerably at the
      top, after which they bend inwards, and form a curve like one half of a
      Cupid&rsquo;s bow. To retain them in place, they are joined together by a sort
      of cross-bar, about half-way in their length; while, to keep them steady,
      they are made to rest on large flat feet. The circular hoop which they
      support is of some width, and is ornamented along its entire course with a
      zig-zag. From the hoop depend, half-way in the spaces between the legs,
      three rings, from each of which there hangs a curious pendant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides copper and bronze, the Phoenicians seem to have worked in lead and
      iron, but only to a small extent. Iron ore might have been obtained in
      some parts of their own country, but appears to have been principally
      derived from abroad, especially from Spain.<a href="#linknote-881"
       name="linknoteref-881" id="linknoteref-881">881</a> It was worked up
      chiefly, so far as we know, into arms offensive and defensive. The sword
      of Alexander, which he received as a gift from the king of Citium,<a
      href="#linknote-882" name="linknoteref-882" id="linknoteref-882">882</a>
      was doubtless in this metal, which is the material of a sword found at
      Amathus, and of numerous arrowheads.<a href="#linknote-883"
       name="linknoteref-883" id="linknoteref-883">883</a> We are also told that
      Cyprus furnished the iron breast-plates worn by Demetrius Poliorcetes;<a
      href="#linknote-884" name="linknoteref-884" id="linknoteref-884">884</a>
      and in pre-Homeric times it was a Phoenician&mdash;Cinyras&mdash;who gave
      to Agamemnon his breast-plate of steel, gold, and tin.<a
      href="#linknote-885" name="linknoteref-885" id="linknoteref-885">885</a>
      That more remains of iron arms and implements have not been found on
      Phoenician sites is probably owing to the rapid oxydisation of the metal,
      which consequently decays and disappears. The Hiram who was sent to assist
      Solomon in building and furnishing the Temple of Jerusalem was, we must
      remember, &ldquo;skilful to work,&rdquo; not only &ldquo;in gold, and silver, and bronze,&rdquo;
       but also &ldquo;in iron."<a href="#linknote-886" name="linknoteref-886"
       id="linknoteref-886">886</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Lead was largely furnished to the Phoenicians by the Scilly Islands,<a
      href="#linknote-887" name="linknoteref-887" id="linknoteref-887">887</a>
      and by Spain.<a href="#linknote-888" name="linknoteref-888"
       id="linknoteref-888">888</a> It has not been found in any great quantity
      on Phoenician sites, but still appears occasionally. Sometimes it is a
      solder uniting stone with bronze;<a href="#linknote-889"
       name="linknoteref-889" id="linknoteref-889">889</a> sometimes it exists in
      thin sheets, which may have been worn as ornaments.<a href="#linknote-890"
       name="linknoteref-890" id="linknoteref-890">890</a> In Phoenicia Proper it
      has been chiefly met with in the shape of coffins,<a href="#linknote-891"
       name="linknoteref-891" id="linknoteref-891">891</a> which are apparently
      of a somewhat late date. They are formed of several sheets placed one over
      the other and then soldered together. There is generally on the lid and
      sides of the coffin an external ornamentation in a low relief, wherein the
      myth of Psyché is said commonly to play a part; but the execution is
      mediocre, and the designs themselves have little merit.

</pre>
    <p>
      The first attempts of the Phoenicians to navigate the sea which washed
      their coast were probably as clumsy and rude as those of other primitive
      nations. They are said to have voyaged from island to island, in their
      original abodes within the Persian Gulf, by means of rafts.<a
      href="#linknote-91" name="linknoteref-91" id="linknoteref-91">91</a> When
      they reached the shores of the Mediterranean, it can scarcely have been
      long ere they constructed boats for fishing and coasting purposes, though
      no doubt such boats were of a very rude construction. Probably, like other
      races, they began with canoes, roughly hewn out of the trunk of a tree.
      The torrents which descended from Lebanon would from time to time bring
      down the stems of fallen trees in their flood-time; and these, floating on
      the Mediterranean waters, would suggest the idea of navigation. They
      would, at first, be hollowed out with hatchets and adzes, or else with
      fire; and, later on, the canoes thus produced would form the models for
      the earliest efforts in shipbuilding. The great length, however, would
      soon be found unnecessary, and the canoe would give place to the boat, in
      the ordinary acceptation of the term. There are models of boats among the
      Phoenician remains which have a very archaic character,<a
      href="#linknote-92" name="linknoteref-92" id="linknoteref-92">92</a> and
      may give us some idea of the vessels in which the Phoenicians of the
      remoter times braved the perils of the deep. They have a keel, not ill
      shaped, a rounded hull, bulwarks, a beak, and a high seat for the
      steersman. The oars, apparently, must have been passed through interstices
      in the bulwark.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this rude shape the transition was not very difficult to the bark
      represented in the sculptures of Sargon,<a href="#linknote-93"
       name="linknoteref-93" id="linknoteref-93">93</a> which is probably a
      Phoenician one. Here four rowers, standing to their oars, impel a vessel
      having for prow the head of a horse and for stern the tail of a fish, both
      of them rising high above the water. The oars are curved, like golf or
      hockey-sticks, and are worked from the gunwale of the bark, though there
      is no indication of rowlocks. The vessel is without a rudder; but it has a
      mast, supported by two ropes which are fastened to the head and stern. The
      mast has neither sail nor yard attached to it, but is crowned by what is
      called a &ldquo;crow&rsquo;s nest&rdquo;&mdash;a bell-shaped receptacle, from which a
      slinger or archer might discharge missiles against an enemy.<a
      href="#linknote-94" name="linknoteref-94" id="linknoteref-94">94</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      A vessel of considerably greater size than this, but of the same class&mdash;impelled,
      that is, by one bank of oars only&mdash;is indicated by certain coins,
      which have been regarded by some critics as Phoenician, by others as
      belonging to Cilicia.<a href="#linknote-95" name="linknoteref-95"
       id="linknoteref-95">95</a> These have a low bow, but an elevated stern;
      the prow exhibits a beak, while the stern shows signs of a steering
      apparatus; the number of the oars on each side is fifteen or twenty. The
      Greeks called these vessels triaconters or penteconters. They are
      represented without any mast on the coins, and thus seem to have been
      merely row-boats of a superior character.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the time of Sennacherib (B.C. 700), or a little earlier, some great
      advances seem to have been made by the Phoenician shipbuilders. In the
      first place, they introduced the practice of placing the rowers on two
      different levels, one above the other; and thus, for a vessel of the same
      length, doubling the number of the rowers. Ships of this kind, which the
      Greeks called &ldquo;biremes,&rdquo; are represented in Sennacherib&rsquo;s sculptures as
      employed by the inhabitants of a Phoenician city, who fly in them at the
      moment when their town is captured, and so escape their enemy.<a
      href="#linknote-96" name="linknoteref-96" id="linknoteref-96">96</a> The
      ships are of two kinds. Both kinds have a double tier of rowers, and both
      are guided by two steering oars thrust out from the stern; but while the
      one is still without mast or sail, and is rounded off in exactly the same
      way both at stem and stern, the other has a mast, placed about midship, a
      yard hung across it, and a sail close reefed to the yard, while the bow is
      armed with a long projecting beak, like a ploughshare, which must have
      been capable of doing terrible damage to a hostile vessel. The rowers, in
      both classes of ships, are represented as only eight or ten upon a side;
      but this may have arisen from artistic necessity, since a greater number
      of figures could not have been introduced without confusion. It is thought
      that in the beaked vessel we have a representation of the Phoenician
      war-galley; in the vessel without a beak, one of the Phoenician transport.<a
      href="#linknote-97" name="linknoteref-97" id="linknoteref-97">97</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      A painting on a vase found in Cyprus exhibits what would seem to have been
      a pleasure-vessel.<a href="#linknote-98" name="linknoteref-98"
       id="linknoteref-98">98</a> It is unbeaked, and without any sign of oars,
      except two paddles for steering with. About midship is a short mast,
      crossed by a long spar or yard, which carries a sail, closely reefed along
      its entire length. The yard and sail are managed by means of four ropes,
      which are, however, somewhat conventionally depicted. Both the head and
      stern of the vessel rise to a considerable height above the water, and the
      stern is curved, very much as in the war-galleys. It perhaps terminated in
      the head of a bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the Greek writers, Phoenician vessels were mainly of two
      kinds, merchant ships and war-vessels.<a href="#linknote-99"
       name="linknoteref-99" id="linknoteref-99">99</a> The merchant ships were
      of a broad, round make, what our sailors would call &ldquo;tubs,&rdquo; resembling
      probably the Dutch fishing-boats of a century ago. They were impelled both
      by oars and sails, but depended mainly on the latter. Each of them had a
      single mast of moderate height, to which a single sail was attached;<a
      href="#linknote-910" name="linknoteref-910" id="linknoteref-910">910</a>
      this was what in modern times is called a &ldquo;square sail,&rdquo; a form which is
      only well suited for sailing with when the wind is directly astern. It was
      apparently attached to the yard, and had to be hoisted together with the
      yard, along which it could be closely reefed, or from which it could be
      loosely shaken out. It was managed, no doubt, by ropes attached to the two
      lower corners, which must have been held in the hands of sailors, as it
      would have been most dangerous to belay them. As long as the wind served,
      the merchant captain used his sail; when it died away, or became adverse,
      he dropped yard and sail on to his deck, and made use of his oars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Merchant ships had, commonly, small boats attached to them, which afforded
      a chance of safety if the ship foundered, and were useful when cargoes had
      to be landed on a shelving shore.<a href="#linknote-911"
       name="linknoteref-911" id="linknoteref-911">911</a> We have no means of
      knowing whether these boats were hoisted up on deck until they were
      wanted, or attached to the ships by ropes and towed after them; but the
      latter arrangement is the more probable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The war-galleys of the Phoenicians in the early times were probably of the
      class which the Greeks called triaconters or penteconters, and which are
      represented upon the coins. They were long open rowboats, in which the
      rowers sat, all of them, upon a level, the number of rowers on either side
      being generally either fifteen or twenty-five. Each galley was armed at
      its head with a sharp metal spike, or beak, which was its chief weapon of
      offence, vessels of this class seeking commonly to run down their enemy.
      After a time these vessels were superseded by biremes, which were decked,
      had masts and sails, and were impelled by rowers sitting at two different
      elevations, as already explained. Biremes were ere long superseded by
      triremes, or vessels with three banks of oars, which are said to have been
      invented at Corinth,<a href="#linknote-912" name="linknoteref-912"
       id="linknoteref-912">912</a> but which came into use among the Phoenicians
      before the end of the sixth century B.C.<a href="#linknote-913"
       name="linknoteref-913" id="linknoteref-913">913</a> In the third century
      B.C. the Carthaginians employed in war quadriremes, and even quinqueremes;
      but there is no evidence of the employment of either class of vessel by
      the Phoenicians of Phoenicia Proper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The superiority of the Phoenician ships to others is generally allowed,
      and was clearly shown when Xerxes collected his fleet of twelve hundred
      and seven triremes against Greece. The fleet included contingents from
      Phoenicia, Cyprus, Egypt, Cilicia, Pamphylia, Lycia, Caria, Ionia, Æolis,
      and the Greek settlements about the Propontis.<a href="#linknote-914"
       name="linknoteref-914" id="linknoteref-914">914</a> When it reached the
      Hellespont, the great king, anxious to test the quality of his ships and
      sailors, made proclamation for a grand sailing match, in which all who
      liked might contend. Each contingent probably&mdash;at any rate, all that
      prided themselves on their nautical skill&mdash;selected its best vessel,
      and entered it for the coming race; the king himself, and his grandees and
      officers, and all the army, stood or sat along the shore to see: the race
      took place, and was won by the Phoenicians of Sidon.<a href="#linknote-915"
       name="linknoteref-915" id="linknoteref-915">915</a> Having thus tested the
      nautical skill of the various nations under his sway, the great king, when
      he ventured his person upon the dangerous element, was careful to embark
      in a Sidonian galley.<a href="#linknote-916" name="linknoteref-916"
       id="linknoteref-916">916</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      A remarkable testimony to the excellence of the Phoenician ships with
      respect to internal arrangements is borne by Xenophon, who puts the
      following words into the mouth of Ischomachus, a Greek:<a
      href="#linknote-917" name="linknoteref-917" id="linknoteref-917">917</a>
      &ldquo;I think that the best and most perfect arrangement of things that I ever
      saw was when I went to look at the great Phoenician sailing-vessel; for I
      saw the largest amount of naval tackling separately disposed in the
      smallest stowage possible. For a ship, as you well know, is brought to
      anchor, and again got under way, by a vast number of wooden implements and
      of ropes and sails the sea by means of a quantity of rigging, and is armed
      with a number of contrivances against hostile vessels, and carries about
      with it a large supply of weapons for the crew, and, besides, has all the
      utensils that a man keeps in his dwelling-house, for each of the messes.
      In addition, it is laden with a quantity of merchandise which the owner
      carries with him for his own profit. Now all the things which I have
      mentioned lay in a space not much bigger than a room which would
      conveniently hold ten beds. And I remarked that they severally lay in a
      way that they did not obstruct one another, and did not require anyone to
      search for them; and yet they were neither placed at random, nor entangled
      one with another, so as to consume time when they were suddenly wanted for
      use. Also, I found the captain&rsquo;s assistant, who is called &lsquo;the look-out
      man,&rsquo; so well acquainted with the position of all the articles, and with
      the number of them, that even when at a distance he could tell where
      everything lay, and how many there were of each sort, just as anyone who
      has learnt to read can tell the number of letters in the name of Socrates
      and the proper place for each of them. Moreover, I saw this man, in his
      leisure moments, examining and testing everything that a vessel needs when
      at sea; so, as I was surprised, I asked him what he was about, whereupon
      he replied&mdash;&lsquo;Stranger, I am looking to see, in case anything should
      happen, how everything is arranged in the ship, and whether anything is
      wanting, or is inconveniently situated; for when a storm arises at sea, it
      is not possible either to look for what is wanting, or to put to right
      what is arranged awkwardly.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phoenician ships seem to have been placed under the protection of the
      Cabeiri, and to have had images of them at their stem or stern or both.<a
      href="#linknote-918" name="linknoteref-918" id="linknoteref-918">918</a>
      These images were not exactly &ldquo;figure-heads,&rdquo; as they are sometimes
      called. They were small, apparently, and inconspicuous, being little dwarf
      figures, regarded as amulets that would preserve the vessel in safety. We
      do not see them on any representations of Phoenician ships, and it is
      possible that they may have been no larger than the bronze or glazed
      earthenware images of Phthah that are so common in Egypt. The Phoenicians
      called them <i>pittuchim</i>, &ldquo;sculptures,"<a href="#linknote-919"
       name="linknoteref-919" id="linknoteref-919">919</a> whence the Greek
      {pataikoi} and the French <i>fétiche</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The navigation of the Phoenicians, in early times, was no doubt cautious
      and timid. So far from venturing out of sight of land, they usually hugged
      the coast, ready at any moment, if the sea or sky threatened, to change
      their course and steer directly for the shore. On a shelving coast they
      were not at all afraid to run their ships aground, since, like the Greek
      vessels, they could be easily pulled up out of reach of the waves, and
      again pulled down and launched, when the storm was over and the sea calm
      once more. At first they sailed, we may be sure, only in the daytime,
      casting anchor at nightfall, or else dragging their ships up upon the
      beach, and so awaiting the dawn. But after a time they grew more bold. The
      sea became familiar to them, the positions of coasts and islands
      relatively one to another better known, the character of the seasons, the
      signs of unsettled or settled weather, the conduct to pursue in an
      emergency, better apprehended. They soon began to shape the course of
      their vessels from headland to headland, instead of always creeping along
      the shore, and it was not perhaps very long before they would venture out
      of sight of land, if their knowledge of the weather satisfied them that
      the wind might be trusted to continue steady, and if they were well
      assured of the direction of the land that they wished to make. They took
      courage, moreover, to sail in the night, no less than in the daytime, when
      the weather was clear, guiding themselves by the stars, and particularly
      by the Polar star,<a href="#linknote-920" name="linknoteref-920"
       id="linknoteref-920">920</a> which they discovered to be the star most
      nearly marking the true north. A passage of Strabo<a href="#linknote-921"
       name="linknoteref-921" id="linknoteref-921">921</a> seems to show that&mdash;in
      the later times at any rate&mdash;they had a method of calculating the
      rate of a ship&rsquo;s sailing, though what the method was is wholly unknown to
      us. It is probable that they early constructed charts and maps, which
      however they would keep secret through jealousy of their commercial

      The Phoenicians for some centuries confined their navigation within the
      limits of the Mediterranean, the Propontis, and the Euxine, land-locked
      seas, which are tideless and far less rough than the open ocean. But
      before the time of Solomon they had passed the Pillars of Hercules, and
      affronted the dangers of the Atlantic.<a href="#linknote-922"
       name="linknoteref-922" id="linknoteref-922">922</a> Their frail and small
      vessels, scarcely bigger than modern fishing-smacks, proceeded southwards
      along the West African coast, as far as the tract watered by the Gambia
      and Senegal, while northwards they coasted along Spain, braved the heavy
      seas of the Bay of Biscay, and passing Cape Finisterre, ventured across
      the mouth of the English Channel to the Cassiterides. Similarly, from the
      West African shore, they boldly steered for the Fortunate Islands (the
      Canaries), visible from certain elevated points of the coast, though at
      170 miles distance. Whether they proceeded further, in the south to the
      Azores, Madeira, and the Cape de Verde Islands, in the north to the coast
      of Holland, and across the German Ocean to the Baltic, we regard as
      uncertain. It is possible that from time to time some of the more
      adventurous of their traders may have reached thus far; but their regular,
      settled, and established navigation did not, we believe, extend beyond the
      Scilly Islands and coast of Cornwall to the north-west, and to the
      south-west Cape Non and the Canaries.

      The commerce of the Phoenicians was carried on, to a large extent, by
      land, though principally by sea. It appears from the famous chapter of
      Ezekiel<a href="#linknote-923" name="linknoteref-923" id="linknoteref-923">923</a>
      which describes the riches and greatness of Tyre in the sixth century
      B.C., that almost the whole of Western Asia was penetrated by the
      Phoenician caravans, and laid under contribution to increase the wealth of
      the Phoenician traders.

     &ldquo;Thou, son of man, (we read) take up a lamentation for Tyre,
          and say
     unto her,
     O thou that dwellest at the entry of the sea,
     Which art the merchant of the peoples unto many isles,
     Thus saith the Lord God, Thou, O Tyre, hast said, I am perfect in
     beauty.
     Thy borders are in the heart of the sea;
     Thy builders have perfected thy beauty.
     They have made all thy planks of fir-trees from Senir;
     They have taken cedars from Lebanon to make a mast for thee
     Of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars;
     They have made thy benches of ivory,
     Inlaid in box-wood, from the isles of Kittim.
     Of fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was thy sail,
     That it might be to thee for an ensign;
     Blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was thy awning.
     The inhabitants of Zidon and of Arvad were thy rowers;
     Thy wise men, O Tyre, were in thee&mdash;they were thy pilots.
     The ancients of Gebal, and their wise men, were thy calkers;
     All the ships of the sea, with their mariners, were in thee,
     That they might occupy thy merchandise.
     Persia, and Lud, and Phut were in thine army, thy men of war;
     They hanged the shield and helmet in thee;
     They set forth thy comeliness.
     The men of Arvad, with thine army, were upon thy walls round about;
     And the Gammadim were in thy towers;
     They hanged their shields upon thy walls round about;
     They have brought to perfection thy beauty.
     Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all
          kinds of
     riches;
     With silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded for thy wares.
     Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were thy traffickers;
     They traded the persons of men, and vessels of brass, for thy
     merchandise.
     They of the house of Togarmah traded for thy wares,
     With horses, and with chargers, and with mules.
     The men of Dedan were thy traffickers; many isles were the mart of
     thy hands;
     They brought thee in exchange horns of ivory, and ebony.
     Syria was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of thy
          handiworks;
     They traded for thy wares with emeralds, purple, and broidered
          work,
     And with fine linen, and coral, and rubies.
     Judah, and the land of Israel, they were thy traffickers;
     They traded for thy merchandise wheat of Minnith,
     And Pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm.
     Damascus was thy merchant for the multitude of thy handiworks;
     By reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches;
     With the wine of Helbon, and white wool.
     Dedan and Javan traded with yarn for thy wares;
     Bright iron, and cassia, and calamus were among thy merchandise.
     Dedan was thy trafficker in precious cloths for riding;
     Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they were the merchants

     hand,
     In lambs, and rams, and goats, in these were they thy merchants.
     The traffickers of Sheba and Raamah, they were thy traffickers;
     They traded for thy wares with chief of all spices,
     And with all manner of precious stones, and gold.
     Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the traffickers of Sheba,
     Asshur and Chilmad, were thy traffickers:
     They were thy traffickers in choice wares,
     In wrappings of blue and broidered work, and in chests of rich
     apparel,
     Bound with cords, and made of cedar, among thy merchandise.
     The ships of Tarshish were thy caravans for they merchandise;
     And thou wast replenished, and made very glorious, in the heart of
     the sea.
     Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters;
     The east wind hath broken thee in the heart of the sea.
     Thy reaches, and thy wares, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy
     pilots,
     Thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy merchandise,
     With all the men of war, that are in thee,
     Shall fall into the heart of the seas in the day of thy ruin.
     At the sound of thy pilot&rsquo;s cry the suburb&rsquo;s shall shake;
     And all that handle the oar, the mariners, and all the pilots
          of the
     sea,
     They shall come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the
     land,
     And shall cause their voice to be heard over thee, and shall cry
     bitterly,
     And shall cast up dust upon their heads, and wallow in the ashes;
     And they shall make themselves bald for thee, and gird them with
     sackcloth,
     And they shall weep for thee in bitterness of soul with bitter
     mourning.
     And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee,
     And lament over thee saying, Who is there like Tyre,
     Like her that is brought to silence in the midst of the sea?
     When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filledst many
     peoples;
     Thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with thy merchandise and
     thy riches.
     In the time that thou was broken by the seas in the depths of the
     waters,
     Thy merchandise, and all thy company, did fall in the midst of
          thee,
     And the inhabitants of the isles are astonished at thee,
     And their kings are sore afraid, they are troubled in their
     countenance,
     The merchants that are among the peoples, hiss at thee;
     Thou art become a terror; and thou shalt never be any more.&rdquo;

      Translating this glorious burst of poetry into prose, we find the
      following countries mentioned as carrying on an active trade with the
      Phoenician metropolis:&mdash;Northern Syria, Syria of Damascus, Judah and
      the land of Israel, Egypt, Arabia, Babylonia, Assyria, Upper Mesopotamia,<a
      href="#linknote-924" name="linknoteref-924" id="linknoteref-924">924</a>
      Armenia,<a href="#linknote-925" name="linknoteref-925" id="linknoteref-925">925</a>
      Central Asia Minor, Ionia, Cyprus, Hellas or Greece,<a href="#linknote-926"
       name="linknoteref-926" id="linknoteref-926">926</a> and Spain.<a
      href="#linknote-927" name="linknoteref-927" id="linknoteref-927">927</a>
      Northern Syria furnishes the Phoenician merchants with <i>butz</i>, which
      is translated &ldquo;fine linen,&rdquo; but is perhaps rather cotton,<a
      href="#linknote-928" name="linknoteref-928" id="linknoteref-928">928</a>
      the &ldquo;tree-wool&rdquo; of Herodotus; it also supplies embroidery, and certain
      precious stones, which our translators have considered to be coral,
      emeralds, and rubies. Syria of Damascus gives the &ldquo;wine of Helbon&rdquo;&mdash;that
      exquisite liquor which was the only sort that the Persian kings would
      condescend to drink<a href="#linknote-929" name="linknoteref-929"
       id="linknoteref-929">929</a>&mdash;and &ldquo;white wool,&rdquo; the dainty fleeces of
      the sheep and lambs that fed on the upland pastures of Hermon and
      Antilibanus. Judah and the land of Israel supply corn of superior quality,
      called &ldquo;corn of Minnith&rdquo;&mdash;corn, i.e. produced in the rich Ammonite
      country<a href="#linknote-930" name="linknoteref-930" id="linknoteref-930">930</a>&mdash;together
      with <i>pannag</i>, an unknown substance, and honey, and balm, and oil.
      Egypt sends fine linen, one of her best known products<a
      href="#linknote-931" name="linknoteref-931" id="linknoteref-931">931</a>&mdash;sometimes,
      no doubt, plain, but often embroidered with bright patterns, and employed
      as such embroidered fabrics were also in Egypt,<a href="#linknote-932"
       name="linknoteref-932" id="linknoteref-932">932</a> for the sails of
      pleasure-boats. Arabia provides her spices, cassia, and calamus (or
      aromatic reed), and, beyond all doubt, frankincense,<a href="#linknote-933"
       name="linknoteref-933" id="linknoteref-933">933</a> and perhaps cinnamon
      and ladanum.<a href="#linknote-934" name="linknoteref-934"
       id="linknoteref-934">934</a> She also supplies wool and goat&rsquo;s hair, and
      cloths for chariots, and gold, and wrought iron, and precious stones, and
      ivory, and ebony, of which the last two cannot have been productions of
      her own, but must have been imported from India or Abyssinia.<a
      href="#linknote-935" name="linknoteref-935" id="linknoteref-935">935</a>
      Babylonia and Assyria furnish &ldquo;wrappings of blue, embroidered work, and
      chests of rich apparel."<a href="#linknote-936" name="linknoteref-936"
       id="linknoteref-936">936</a> Upper Mesopotamia partakes in this traffic.<a
      href="#linknote-937" name="linknoteref-937" id="linknoteref-937">937</a>
      Armenia gives horses and mules. Central Asia Minor (Tubal and Meshech)
      supplies slaves and vessels of brass, and the Greeks of Ionia do the like.
      Cyprus furnishes ivory, which she must first have imported from abroad.<a
      href="#linknote-938" name="linknoteref-938" id="linknoteref-938">938</a>
      Greece Proper sends her shell-fish, to enable the Phoenician cities to
      increase their manufacture of the purple dye.<a href="#linknote-939"
       name="linknoteref-939" id="linknoteref-939">939</a> Finally, Spain yields
      silver, iron, tin, and lead&mdash;the most useful of the metals&mdash;all
      of which she is known to have produced in abundance.<a href="#linknote-940"
       name="linknoteref-940" id="linknoteref-940">940</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      With the exception of Egypt, Ionia, Cyprus, Hellas, and Spain, the
      Phoenician intercourse with these places must have been carried on wholly
      by land. Even with Egypt, wherewith the communication by sea was so
      facile, there seems to have been also from a very early date a land
      commerce. The land commerce was in every case carried on by caravans.
      Western Asia has never yet been in so peaceful and orderly condition as to
      dispense prudent traders from the necessity of joining together in large
      bodies, well provisioned and well armed, when they are about to move
      valuable goods any considerable distance. There have always been
      robber-tribes in the mountain tracts, and thievish Arabs upon the plains,
      ready to pounce on the insufficiently protected traveller, and to despoil
      him of all his belongings. Hence the necessity of the caravan traffic. As
      early as the time of Joseph&mdash;probably about B.C. 1600&mdash;we find a
      <i>company</i> of the Midianites on their way from Gilead, with their
      camels bearing spicery, and balm, and myrrh, going to carry it down to
      Egypt.<a href="#linknote-941" name="linknoteref-941" id="linknoteref-941">941</a>
      Elsewhere we hear of the &ldquo;travelling <i>companies</i> of the Dedanim,"<a
      href="#linknote-942" name="linknoteref-942" id="linknoteref-942">942</a>
      of the men of Sheba bringing their gold and frankincense;<a
      href="#linknote-943" name="linknoteref-943" id="linknoteref-943">943</a>
      of a multitude of camels coming up to Palestine with wood from Kedar and
      Nebaioth.<a href="#linknote-944" name="linknoteref-944"
       id="linknoteref-944">944</a> Heeren is entirely justified in his
      conclusion that the land trade of the Phoenicians was conducted by &ldquo;large
      companies or caravans, since it could only have been carried on in this
      way."<a href="#linknote-945" name="linknoteref-945" id="linknoteref-945">945</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The nearest neighbours of the Phoenicians on the land side were the Jews
      and Israelites, the Syrians of Damascus, and the people of Northern Syria,
      or the Orontes valley and the tract east of it. From the Jews and
      Israelites the Phoenicians seem to have derived at all times almost the
      whole of the grain which they were forced to import for their sustenance.
      In the time of David and Solomon it was chiefly for wheat and barley that
      they exchanged the commodities which they exported,<a href="#linknote-946"
       name="linknoteref-946" id="linknoteref-946">946</a> in that of Ezekiel it
      was primarily for &ldquo;wheat of Minnith;"<a href="#linknote-947"
       name="linknoteref-947" id="linknoteref-947">947</a> and a similar trade is
      noted on the return of the Jews from the captivity,<a href="#linknote-948"
       name="linknoteref-948" id="linknoteref-948">948</a> and in the first
      century of our era.<a href="#linknote-949" name="linknoteref-949"
       id="linknoteref-949">949</a> But besides grain they also imported from
      Palestine at some periods wine, oil, honey, balm, and oak timber.<a
      href="#linknote-950" name="linknoteref-950" id="linknoteref-950">950</a>
      Western Palestine was notoriously a land not only of corn, but also of
      wine, of olive oil, and of honey, and could readily impart of its
      superfluity to its neighbour in time of need. The oaks of Bashan are very
      abundant, and seem to have been preferred by the Phoenicians to their own
      oaks as the material of oars.<a href="#linknote-951" name="linknoteref-951"
       id="linknoteref-951">951</a> Balm, or basalm, was a product of the land of
      Gilead,<a href="#linknote-952" name="linknoteref-952" id="linknoteref-952">952</a>
      and also of the lower Jordan valley, where it was of superior quality.<a
      href="#linknote-953" name="linknoteref-953" id="linknoteref-953">953</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      From the Damascene Syrians we are told that Phoenicia imported &ldquo;wine of
      Helbon&rdquo; and &ldquo;white wool."<a href="#linknote-954" name="linknoteref-954"
       id="linknoteref-954">954</a> The &ldquo;wine of Helbon&rdquo; is reasonably identified
      with that {oinos Khalubonios} which is said to have been the favourite
      beverage of the Persian kings.<a href="#linknote-955"
       name="linknoteref-955" id="linknoteref-955">955</a> It was perhaps grown
      in the neighbourhood of Aleppo.<a href="#linknote-956"
       name="linknoteref-956" id="linknoteref-956">956</a> The &ldquo;white wool&rdquo; may
      have been furnished by the sheep that cropped the slopes of the
      Antilibanus, or by those fed on the fine grass which clothes most of the
      plain at its base. The fleece of these last is, according to Heeren,<a
      href="#linknote-957" name="linknoteref-957" id="linknoteref-957">957</a>
      &ldquo;the finest known, being improved by the heat of the climate, the
      continual exposure to the open air, and the care commonly bestowed upon
      the flocks.&rdquo; From the Syrian wool, mixed perhaps with some other material,
      seems to have been woven the fabric known, from the city where it was
      commonly made,<a href="#linknote-958" name="linknoteref-958"
       id="linknoteref-958">958</a> as &ldquo;damask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      According to the existing text of Ezekiel,<a href="#linknote-959"
       name="linknoteref-959" id="linknoteref-959">959</a> Syria Proper &ldquo;occupied
      in the fairs&rdquo; of Phoenicia with cotton, with embroidered robes, with
      purple, and with precious stones. The valley of the Orontes is suitable
      for the cultivation of cotton; and embroidered robes would naturally be
      produced in the seat of an old civilisation, which Syria certainly was.
      Purple seems somewhat out of place in the enumeration; but the Syrians may
      have gathered the <i>murex</i> on their seaboard between Mt. Casius and
      the Gulf of Issus, and have sold what they collected in the Phoenician
      market. The precious stones which Ezekiel assigns to them are difficult of
      identification, but may have been furnished by Casius, Bargylus, or
      Amanus. These mountains, or at any rate Casius and Amanus, are of igneous
      origin, and, if carefully explored, would certainly yield gems to the
      investigator. At the same time it must be acknowledged that Syria had not,
      in antiquity, the name of a gem-producing country; and, so far, the
      reading of &ldquo;Edom&rdquo; for &ldquo;Aram,&rdquo; which is preferred by many,<a
      href="#linknote-960" name="linknoteref-960" id="linknoteref-960">960</a>
      may seem to be the more probable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commerce of the Phoenicians with Egypt was ancient, and very
      extensive. &ldquo;The wares of Egypt&rdquo; are mentioned by Herodotus as a portion of
      the merchandise which they brought to Greece before the time of the Trojan
      War.<a href="#linknote-961" name="linknoteref-961" id="linknoteref-961">961</a>
      The Tyrians had a quarter in the city of Memphis assigned to them,<a
      href="#linknote-962" name="linknoteref-962" id="linknoteref-962">962</a>
      probably from an early date. According to Ezekiel, the principal commodity
      which Egypt furnished to Phoenicia was &ldquo;fine linen"<a href="#linknote-963"
       name="linknoteref-963" id="linknoteref-963">963</a>&mdash;especially the
      linen sails embroidered with gay patterns, which the Egyptian nobles
      affected for their pleasure-boats. They probably also imported from Egypt
      natron for their glass-works, papyrus for their documents, earthenware of
      various kinds for exportation, scarabs and other seals, statuettes and
      figures of gods, amulets, and in the later times sarcophagi.<a
      href="#linknote-964" name="linknoteref-964" id="linknoteref-964">964</a>
      Their exports to Egypt consisted of wine on a large scale,<a
      href="#linknote-965" name="linknoteref-965" id="linknoteref-965">965</a>
      tin almost certainly, and probably their peculiar purple fabrics, and
      other manufactured articles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Phoenician trade with Arabia was of especial importance, since not
      only did the great peninsula itself produce many of the most valuable
      articles of commerce, but it was also mainly, if not solely, through
      Arabia that the Indian market was thrown open to the Phoenician traders,
      and the precious commodities obtained for which Hindustan has always been
      famous. Arabia is <i>par excellence</i> the land of spices, and was the
      main source from which the ancient world in general, and Phoenicia in
      particular, obtained frankincense, cinnamon, cassia, myrrh, calamus or
      sweet-cane, and ladanum.<a href="#linknote-966" name="linknoteref-966"
       id="linknoteref-966">966</a> It has been doubted whether these commodities
      were, all of them, the actual produce of the country in ancient times, and
      Herodotus has been in some degree discredited, but perhaps without
      sufficient reason. He is supported to a considerable extent by
      Theophrastus, the disciple of Aristotle, who says:<a href="#linknote-967"
       name="linknoteref-967" id="linknoteref-967">967</a> &ldquo;Frankincense, myrrh,
      and cassia grow in the Arabian districts of Saba and Hadramaut;
      frankincense and myrrh on the sides or at the foot of mountains, and in
      the neighbouring islands. The trees which produce them grow sometimes
      wild, though occasionally they are cultivated; and the frankincense-tree
      grows sometimes taller than the tree producing the myrrh.&rdquo; Modern
      authorities declare the frankincense-tree (<i>Boswellia thurifera</i>) to
      be still a native of Hadramaut;<a href="#linknote-968"
       name="linknoteref-968" id="linknoteref-968">968</a> and there is no doubt
      that the myrrh-tree (<i>Balsamodendron myrrha</i>) also grows there. If
      cinnamon and cassia, as the terms are now understood, do not at present
      grow in Arabia, or nearer to Phoenicia than Hindustan, it may be that they
      have died out in the former country, or our modern use of the terms may
      differ from the ancient one. On the other hand, it is no doubt possible
      that the Phoenicians imagined all the spices which they obtained from
      Arabia to be the indigenous growth of the country, when in fact some of
      them were importations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next to her spices, Arabia was famous for the production of a superior
      quality of wool. The Phoenicians imported this wool largely. The flocks of
      Kedar are especially noted,<a href="#linknote-969" name="linknoteref-969"
       id="linknoteref-969">969</a> and are said to have included both sheep and
      goats.<a href="#linknote-970" name="linknoteref-970" id="linknoteref-970">970</a>
      It was perhaps a native woollen manufacture, in which Dedan traded with
      Tyre, and which Ezekiel notices as a trade in &ldquo;cloths for chariots."<a
      href="#linknote-971" name="linknoteref-971" id="linknoteref-971">971</a>
      Goat&rsquo;s hair was largely employed in the production of coverings for tents.<a
      href="#linknote-972" name="linknoteref-972" id="linknoteref-972">972</a>
      Arabia also furnished Phoenicia with gold, with precious stones, with
      ivory, ebony, and wrought iron.<a href="#linknote-973"
       name="linknoteref-973" id="linknoteref-973">973</a> The wrought iron was
      probably from Yemen, which was celebrated for its manufacture of sword
      blades. The gold may have been native, for there is much reason to believe
      that anciently the Arabian mountain ranges yielded gold as freely as the
      Ethiopian,<a href="#linknote-974" name="linknoteref-974"
       id="linknoteref-974">974</a> with which they form one system; or it may
      have been imported from Hindustan, with which Arabia had certainly, in
      ancient times, constant communication. Ivory and ebony must, beyond a
      doubt, have been Arabian importations. There are two countries from which
      they may have been derived, India and Abyssinia. It is likely that the
      commercial Arabs of the south-east coast had dealings with both.<a
      href="#linknote-975" name="linknoteref-975" id="linknoteref-975">975</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Phoenician imports into Arabia we have no account; but we may
      conjecture that they consisted principally of manufactured goods, cotton
      and linen fabrics, pottery, implements and utensils in metal, beads, and
      other ornaments for the person, and the like. The nomadic Arabs, leading a
      simple life, required but little beyond what their own country produced;
      there was, however, a town population<a href="#linknote-976"
       name="linknoteref-976" id="linknoteref-976">976</a> in the more southern
      parts of the peninsula, to which the elegancies and luxuries of life,
      commonly exported by Phoenicia, would have been welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Phoenician trade with Babylonia and Assyria was carried on probably by
      caravans, which traversed the Syrian desert by way of Tadmor or Palmyra,
      and struck the Euphrates about Circesium. Here the route divided, passing
      to Babylon southwards along the course of the great river, and to Nineveh
      eastwards by way of the Khabour and the Sinjar mountain-range. Both
      countries seem to have supplied the Phoenicians with fabrics of
      extraordinary value, rich in a peculiar embroidery, and deemed so precious
      that they were packed in chests of cedar-wood, which the Phoenician
      merchants must have brought with them from Lebanon.<a href="#linknote-977"
       name="linknoteref-977" id="linknoteref-977">977</a> The wares furnished by
      Assyria were in some cases exported to Greece,<a href="#linknote-978"
       name="linknoteref-978" id="linknoteref-978">978</a> while no doubt in
      others they were intended for home consumption. They included cylinders in
      rock crystal, jasper, hematite, steatite, and other materials, which may
      sometimes have found purchasers in Phoenicia Proper, but appear to have
      been specially affected by the Phoenician colonists in Cyprus.<a
      href="#linknote-979" name="linknoteref-979" id="linknoteref-979">979</a>
      On her part Phoenicia must have imported into Assyria and Babylonia the
      tin which was a necessary element in their bronze; and they seem also to
      have found a market in Assyria for their own most valuable and artistic
      bronzes, the exquisite embossed pateræ which are among the most precious
      of the treasures brought by Sir Austen Layard from Nineveh.<a
      href="#linknote-980" name="linknoteref-980" id="linknoteref-980">980</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The nature of the Phoenician trade with Upper Mesopotamia is unknown to
      us; and it is not impossible that their merchants visited Haran,<a
      href="#linknote-981" name="linknoteref-981" id="linknoteref-981">981</a>
      rather because it lay on the route which they had to follow in order to
      reach Armenia than because it possessed in itself any special attraction
      for them. Gall-nuts and manna are almost the only products for which the
      region is celebrated; and of these Phoenicia herself produced the one,
      while she probably did not need the other. But the natural route to
      Armenia was by way of the Coelesyrian valley, Aleppo and Carchemish, to
      Haran, and thence by Amida or Diarbekr to Van, which was the capital of
      Armenia in the early times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armenia supplied the Phoenicians with &ldquo;horses of common and of noble
      breeds,"<a href="#linknote-982" name="linknoteref-982" id="linknoteref-982">982</a>
      and also with mules.<a href="#linknote-983" name="linknoteref-983"
       id="linknoteref-983">983</a> Strabo says that it was a country exceedingly
      well adapted for the breeding of the horse,<a href="#linknote-984"
       name="linknoteref-984" id="linknoteref-984">984</a> and even notes the two
      qualities of the animal that it produced, one of which he calls &ldquo;Nisæan,&rdquo;
       though the true &ldquo;Nisæan plain&rdquo; was in Media. So large was the number of
      colts bred each year, and so highly were they valued, that, under the
      Persian monarchy the Great King exacted from the province, as a regular
      item of its tribute, no fewer than twenty thousand of them annually.<a
      href="#linknote-985" name="linknoteref-985" id="linknoteref-985">985</a>
      Armenian mules seem not to be mentioned by any writer besides Ezekiel; but
      mules were esteemed throughout the East in antiquity,<a
      href="#linknote-986" name="linknoteref-986" id="linknoteref-986">986</a>
      and no country would have been more likely to breed them than the mountain
      tract of Armenia, the Switzerland of Western Asia, where such surefooted
      animals would be especially needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armenia adjoined the country of the Moschi and Tibareni&mdash;the Meshech
      and Tubal of the Bible. These tribes, between the ninth and the seventh
      centuries B.C., inhabited the central regions of Asia Minor and the
      country known later as Cappadocia. They traded with Tyre in the &ldquo;persons
      of men&rdquo; and in &ldquo;vessels of brass&rdquo; or copper.<a href="#linknote-987"
       name="linknoteref-987" id="linknoteref-987">987</a> Copper is found
      abundantly in the mountain ranges of these parts, and Xenophon remarks on
      the prevalence of metal vessels in the portion of the region which he
      passed through&mdash;the country of the Carduchians.<a href="#linknote-988"
       name="linknoteref-988" id="linknoteref-988">988</a> The traffic in slaves
      was one in which the Phoenicians engaged from very early times. They were
      not above kidnapping men, women, and children in one country and selling
      them into another;<a href="#linknote-989" name="linknoteref-989"
       id="linknoteref-989">989</a> besides which they seem to have frequented
      regularly the principal slave marts of the time. They bought such Jews as
      were taken captive and sold into slavery by the neighbouring nations,<a
      href="#linknote-990" name="linknoteref-990" id="linknoteref-990">990</a>
      and they looked to the Moschi and Tibareni for a constant supply of the
      commodity from the Black Sea region.<a href="#linknote-991"
       name="linknoteref-991" id="linknoteref-991">991</a> The Caucasian tribes
      have always been in the habit of furnishing slave-girls to the harems of
      the East, and the Thracians, who were not confined to Europe, but occupied
      a great part of Asia Minor, regularly trafficked in their children.<a
      href="#linknote-992" name="linknoteref-992" id="linknoteref-992">992</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the extent of the Phoenician land trade, as indicated by the
      prophet Ezekiel, and such were, so far as is at present known, the
      commodities interchanged in the course of it. It is quite possible&mdash;nay,
      probable&mdash;that the trade extended much further, and certain that it
      must have included many other articles of commerce besides those which we
      have mentioned. The sources of our information on the subject are so few
      and scanty, and the notices from which we derive our knowledge for the
      most part so casual, that we may be sure what is preserved is but a most
      imperfect record of what was&mdash;fragments of wreck recovered from the
      sea of oblivion. It may have been a Phoenician caravan route which
      Herodotus describes as traversed on one occasion by the Nasamonians,<a
      href="#linknote-993" name="linknoteref-993" id="linknoteref-993">993</a>
      which began in North Africa and terminated with the Niger and the city of
      Timbuctoo; and another, at which he hints as lying between the coast of
      the Lotus-eaters and Fezzan.<a href="#linknote-994" name="linknoteref-994"
       id="linknoteref-994">994</a> Phoenician traders may have accompanied and
      stimulated the slave hunts of the Garamantians,<a href="#linknote-995"
       name="linknoteref-995" id="linknoteref-995">995</a> as Arab traders do
      those of the Central African nations at the present day. Again, it is
      quite possible that the Phoenicians of Memphis designed and organised the
      caravans which, proceeding from Egyptian Thebes, traversed Africa from
      east to west along the line of the &ldquo;Salt Hills,&rdquo; by way of Ammon, Augila,
      Fezzan, and the Tuarik country to Mount Atlas.<a href="#linknote-996"
       name="linknoteref-996" id="linknoteref-996">996</a> We can scarcely
      imagine the Egyptians showing so much enterprise. But these lines of
      traffic can be ascribed to the Phoenicians only by conjecture, history
      being silent on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sea trade of the Phoenicians was still more extensive than their land
      traffic. It is divisible into two branches, their trade with their own
      colonists, and that with the natives of the various countries to which
      they penetrated in their voyages. The colonies sent out from Phoenicia
      were, except in the single instance of Carthage, trading settlements,
      planted where some commodity or commodities desired by the mother-country
      abounded, and were intended to secure to the mother-country the monopoly
      of such commodity or commodities. For instance, Cyprus was colonised for
      the sake of its copper mines and its timber; Cilicia and Lycia for their
      timber only; Thasos for its gold mines; Salamis and Cythera for the purple
      trade; Sardinia and Spain for their numerous metals; North Africa for its
      fertility and for the trade with the interior. Phoenicia expected to
      derive, primarily, from each colony the commodity or commodities which had
      caused the selection of the site. In return she supplied the colonists
      with her own manufactured articles; with fabrics in linen, wool, cotton,
      and perhaps to some extent in silk; with every variety of pottery, from
      dishes and jugs of the plainest and most simple kind to the most costly
      and elaborate vases and amphoræ; with metal utensils and arms, with gold
      and silver ornaments, with embossed shields and pateræ, with faïnce and
      glass, and also with any foreign products or manufactures that they
      desired and that the countries within the range of her influence could
      furnish. Phoenicia must have imported into Cyprus, to suit a peculiar
      Cyprian taste, the Egyptian statuettes, scarabs, and rings,<a
      href="#linknote-997" name="linknoteref-997" id="linknoteref-997">997</a>
      and the Assyrian and Babylonian cylinders, which have been found there.
      The tin which she brought from the Cassiterides she distributed generally,
      for she did not discourage her colonists from manufacturing for themselves
      to some extent. There was probably no colony which did not make its own
      bronze vessels of the commoner sort and its own coarser pottery.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her trade with the nations who peopled the coasts of the Mediterranean,
      the Propontis, and the Black Sea, Phoenicia aimed primarily at disposing
      to advantage of her own commodities, secondarily at making a profit in
      commodities which she had obtained from other countries, and thirdly on
      obtaining commodities which she might dispose of to advantage elsewhere.
      Where the nations were uncivilised, or in a low condition of civilisation,
      she looked to making a large profit by furnishing them at a cheap rate
      with all the simplest conveniences of life, with their pottery, their
      implements and utensils, their clothes, their arms, the ornaments of their
      persons and of their houses. Underselling the native producers, she soon
      obtained a monopoly of this kind of trade, drove the native products out
      of the market, and imposed her own instead, much as the manufacturers of
      Manchester, Birmingham, and the Potteries impose their calicoes, their
      cutlery, and their earthenware on the savages of Africa and Polynesia.
      Where culture was more advanced, as in Greece and parts of Italy,<a
      href="#linknote-998" name="linknoteref-998" id="linknoteref-998">998</a>
      she looked to introduce, and no doubt succeeded in introducing, the best
      of her own productions, fabrics of crimson, violet, and purple, painted
      vases, embossed pateræ, necklaces, bracelets, rings&mdash;&ldquo;cunning work&rdquo;
       of all manner of kinds<a href="#linknote-999" name="linknoteref-999"
       id="linknoteref-999">999</a>&mdash;mirrors, glass vessels, and
      smelling-bottles. At the same time she also disposed at a profit of many
      of the wares that she had imported from foreign countries, which were
      advanced in certain branches of art, as Egypt, Babylonia, Assyria,
      possibly India. The muslins and ivory of Hindustan, the shawls of Kashmir,
      the carpets of Babylon, the spices of Araby the Blest, the pearls of the
      Persian Gulf, the faïence and the papyrus of Egypt, would be readily taken
      by the more civilised of the Western nations, who would be prepared to pay
      a high price for them. They would pay for them partly, no doubt, in silver
      and gold, but to some extent also in their own manufactured commodities,
      Attica in her ceramic products, Corinth in her &ldquo;brass,&rdquo; Etruria in her
      candelabra and engraved mirrors,<a href="#linknote-9100"       name="linknoteref-9100" id="linknoteref-9100">9100</a> Argos in her highly
      elaborated ornaments.<a href="#linknote-9101" name="linknoteref-9101"       id="linknoteref-9101">9101</a> Or, in some cases, they might make return
      out of the store wherewith nature had provided them, Euboea rendering her
      copper, the Peloponnese her &ldquo;purple,&rdquo; Crete her timber, the Cyrenaica its
      silphium.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the Pillars of Hercules the Phoenicians had only savage nations to
      deal with, and with these they seem to have traded mainly for the purpose
      of obtaining certain natural products, either peculiarly valuable or
      scarcely procurable elsewhere. Their trade with the Scilly Islands and the
      coast of Cornwall was especially for the procuring of tin. Of all the
      metals, tin is found in the fewest places, and though Spain seems to have
      yielded some anciently,<a href="#linknote-9102" name="linknoteref-9102"       id="linknoteref-9102">9102</a> yet it can only have been in small
      quantities, while there was an enormous demand for tin in all parts of the
      old world, since bronze was the material almost universally employed for
      arms, tools, implements, and utensils of all kinds, while tin is the most
      important, though not the largest, element in bronze. From the time that
      the Phoenicians discovered the Scilly Islands&mdash;the &ldquo;Tin Islands&rdquo;
       (Cassiterides), as they called them&mdash;it is probable that the tin of
      the civilised world was almost wholly derived from this quarter. Eastern
      Asia, no doubt, had always its own mines, and may have exported tin to
      some extent, in the remoter times, supplying perhaps the needs of Egypt,
      Assyria, and Babylon. But, after the rich stores of the metal which our
      own islands possess were laid open, and the Phoenicians with their
      extensive commercial dealings, both in the West and in the East, became
      interested in diffusing it, British tin probably drove all other out of
      use, and obtained the monopoly of the markets wherever Phoenician
      influence prevailed. Hence the trade with the Cassiterides was constant,
      and so highly prized that a Phoenician captain, finding his ship followed
      by a Roman vessel, preferred running it upon the rocks to letting a rival
      nation learn the secret of how the tin-producing coast might be approached
      in safety.<a href="#linknote-9103" name="linknoteref-9103"       id="linknoteref-9103">9103</a> With the tin it was usual for the merchants
      to combine a certain amount of lead and a certain quantity of skins or
      hides; while they gave in exchange pottery, salt, and articles in bronze,
      such as arms, implements, and utensils for cooking and for the table.<a
      href="#linknote-9104" name="linknoteref-9104" id="linknoteref-9104">9104</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Phoenicians visited, as some maintain that they did,<a
      href="#linknote-9105" name="linknoteref-9105" id="linknoteref-9105">9105</a>
      the coasts of the Baltic, it must have been for the purpose of obtaining
      amber. Amber is thrown up largely by the waters of that land-locked sea,
      and at present especially abounds on the shore in the vicinity of Dantzic.
      It is very scarce elsewhere. The Phoenicians seem to have made use of
      amber in their necklaces from a very early date;<a href="#linknote-9106"       name="linknoteref-9106" id="linknoteref-9106">9106</a> and, though they
      might no doubt have obtained it by land-carriage across Europe to the head
      of the Adriatic, yet their enterprise and their commercial spirit were
      such as would not improbably have led them to seek to open a direct
      communication with the amber-producing region, so soon as they knew where
      it was situated. The dangers of the German Ocean are certainly not greater
      than those of the Atlantic; and if the Phoenicians had sufficient skill in
      navigation to reach Britain and the Fortunate Islands, they could have
      found no very serious difficulty in penetrating to the Baltic. On the
      other hand, there is no direct evidence of their having penetrated so far,
      and perhaps the Adriatic trade may have supplied them with as much amber
      as they needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trade of the Phoenicians with the west coast of Africa had for its
      principal objects the procuring of ivory, of elephant, lion, leopard, and
      deer-skins, and probably of gold. Scylax relates that there was an
      established trade in his day (about B.C. 350) between Phoenicia and an
      island which he calls Cerne, probably Arguin, off the West African coast.
      &ldquo;The merchants,&rdquo; he says,<a href="#linknote-9107" name="linknoteref-9107"       id="linknoteref-9107">9107</a> &ldquo;who are Phoenicians, when they have
      arrived at Cerne, anchor their vessels there, and after having pitched
      their tents upon the shore, proceed to unload their cargo, and to convey
      it in smaller boats to the mainland. The dealers with whom they trade are
      Ethiopians; and these dealers sell to the Phoenicians skins of deer,
      lions, panthers, and domestic animals&mdash;elephants&rsquo; skins also, and
      their teeth. The Ethiopians wear embroidered garments, and use ivory cups
      as drinking vessels; their women adorn themselves with ivory bracelets;
      and their horses also are adorned with ivory. The Phoenicians convey to
      them ointment, elaborate vessels from Egypt, castrated swine(?), and Attic
      pottery and cups. These last they commonly purchase [in Athens] at the
      Feast of Cups. These Ethiopians are eaters of flesh and drinkers of milk;
      they make also much wine from the vine; and the Phoenicians, too, supply
      some wine to them. They have a considerable city, to which the Phoenicians
      sail up.&rdquo; The river on which the city stood was probably the Senegal.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be observed that Scylax says nothing in this passage of any
      traffic for gold. We can scarcely suppose, however, that the Phoenicians,
      if they penetrated so far south as this, could remain ignorant of the fact
      that West Africa was a gold-producing country, much less that, being aware
      of the fact, they would fail to utilise it. Probably they were the first
      to establish that &ldquo;dumb commerce&rdquo; which was afterwards carried on with so
      much advantage to themselves by the Carthaginians, and whereof Herodotus
      gives so graphic an account. &ldquo;There is a country,&rdquo; he says,<a
      href="#linknote-9108" name="linknoteref-9108" id="linknoteref-9108">9108</a>
      &ldquo;in Libya, and a nation, beyond the Pillars of Hercules, which the
      Carthaginians are wont to visit, where they no sooner arrive than
      forthwith they unlade their wares, and having disposed them after an
      orderly fashion along the beach, there leave them, and returning aboard
      their ships, raise a great smoke. The natives, when they see the sample,
      come down to the shore, and laying out to view so much gold as they think
      the wares are worth, withdraw to a distance. The Carthaginians upon this
      come ashore again and look. If they think the gold to be enough, they take
      it and go their way; but if it does not seem to them sufficient, they go
      aboard ship once more, and wait patiently. Then the others approach and
      add to their gold, till the Carthaginians are satisfied. Neither party
      deals unfairly by the other: for they themselves never touch the gold till
      it comes up to the worth of their goods, nor do the natives ever carry off
      the goods until the gold has been taken away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The nature of the Phoenician trade with the Canaries, or Fortunate
      Islands, is not stated by any ancient author, and can only be conjectured.
      It would scarcely have been worth the Phoenicians&rsquo; while to convey timber
      to Syria from such a distance, or we might imagine the virgin forests of
      the islands attracting them.<a href="#linknote-9109"       name="linknoteref-9109" id="linknoteref-9109">9109</a> The large breed of
      dogs from which the Canaries derived their later name<a
      href="#linknote-9110" name="linknoteref-9110" id="linknoteref-9110">9110</a>
      may perhaps have constituted an article of export even in Phoenician
      times, as we know they did later, when we hear of their being conveyed to
      King Juba;<a href="#linknote-9111" name="linknoteref-9111"       id="linknoteref-9111">9111</a> but there is an entire lack of evidence on
      the subject. Perhaps the Phoenicians frequented the islands less for the
      sake of commerce than for that of watering and refitting the ships engaged
      in the African trade, since the natives were less formidable than those
      who inhabited the mainland.<a href="#linknote-9112" name="linknoteref-9112"       id="linknoteref-9112">9112</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one further direction in which the Phoenicians pushed their
      maritime trade, not perhaps continuously, but at intervals, when their
      political relations were such as to give them access to the sea which
      washed Asia on the south and on the southeast. The nearest points at which
      they could embark for the purpose of exploring or utilising the great
      tract of ocean in this quarter were the inner recesses of the two deep
      gulfs known as the Persian and the Arabian. It has been thought by some<a
      href="#linknote-9113" name="linknoteref-9113" id="linknoteref-9113">9113</a>
      that there were times in their history when the Phoenicians had the free
      use of both these gulfs, and could make the starting-point of their
      eastern explorations and trading voyages either a port on one of the two
      arms into which the Red Sea divides towards the north, or a harbour on the
      Persian Gulf near its north-western extremity. But the latter supposition
      rests upon grounds which are exceedingly unsafe and uncertain. That the
      Phoenicians migrated at some remote period from the shores of the Persian
      Gulf to the Mediterranean may be allowed to be highly probable; but that,
      after quitting their primitive abodes and moving off nearly a thousand
      miles to the westward, they still maintained a connection with their early
      settlements and made them centres for a trade with the Far East, is as
      improbable a hypothesis as any that has ever received the sanction of men
      of learning and repute. The Babylonians, through whose country the
      connection must have been kept up, were themselves traders, and would
      naturally keep the Arabian and Indian traffic in their own hands; nor can
      we imagine them as brooking the establishment of a rival upon their
      shores. The Arabians were more friendly; but they, too, would have
      disliked to share their carrying trade with a foreign nation. And the
      evidence entirely fails to show that the Phoenicians, from the time of
      their removal to the Mediterranean, ever launched a vessel in the Persian
      Gulf, or had any connection with the nations inhabiting its shores, beyond
      that maintained by the caravans which trafficked by land between the
      Phoenician cities and the men of Dedan and Babylon.<a href="#linknote-9114"       name="linknoteref-9114" id="linknoteref-9114">9114</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It was otherwise with the more western gulf. There, certainly, from time
      to time, the Phoenicians launched their fleets, and carried on a commerce
      which was scarcely less lucrative because they had to allow the nations
      whose ports they used a participation in its profits. It is not impossible
      that, occasionally, the Egyptians allowed them to build ships in some one
      or more of their Red Sea ports, and to make such port or ports the
      head-quarters of a trade which may have proceeded beyond the Straits of
      Babelmandeb and possibly have reached Zanzibar and Ceylon. At any rate, we
      know that, in the time of Solomon, two harbours upon the Red Sea were open
      to them&mdash;viz. Eloth and Ezion-Geber&mdash;both places situated in the
      inner recess of the Elanitic Gulf, or Gulf of Akaba, the more eastern of
      the two arms into which the Red Sea divides. David&rsquo;s conquest of Edom had
      put these ports into the possession of the Israelites, and the friendship
      between Hiram and Solomon had given the Phoenicians free access to them.
      It was the ambition of Solomon to make the Israelites a nautical people,
      and to participate in the advantages which he perceived to have accrued to
      Phoenicia from her commercial enterprise. Besides sharing with the
      Phoenicians in the trade of the Mediterranean,<a href="#linknote-9115"       name="linknoteref-9115" id="linknoteref-9115">9115</a> he constructed with
      their help a fleet at Ezion-Geber upon the Red Sea,<a href="#linknote-9116"       name="linknoteref-9116" id="linknoteref-9116">9116</a> and the two allies
      conjointly made voyages to the region, or country, called Ophir, for the
      purpose of procuring precious stones, gold, and almug-wood.<a
      href="#linknote-9117" name="linknoteref-9117" id="linknoteref-9117">9117</a>
      Ophir is, properly speaking, a portion of Arabia,<a href="#linknote-9118"       name="linknoteref-9118" id="linknoteref-9118">9118</a> and Arabia was
      famous for its production of gold,<a href="#linknote-9119"       name="linknoteref-9119" id="linknoteref-9119">9119</a> and also for its
      precious stones.<a href="#linknote-9120" name="linknoteref-9120"       id="linknoteref-9120">9120</a> Whether it likewise produced almug-trees is
      doubtful;<a href="#linknote-9121" name="linknoteref-9121"       id="linknoteref-9121">9121</a> and it is quite possible that the joint
      fleet went further than Ophir proper, and obtained the &ldquo;almug-wood&rdquo; from
      the east coast of Africa, or from India. The Somauli country might have
      been as easily reached as South-eastern Arabia, and if India is
      considerably more remote, yet there was nothing to prevent the Phoenicians
      from finding their way to it.<a href="#linknote-9122"       name="linknoteref-9122" id="linknoteref-9122">9122</a> We have, however,
      no direct evidence that their commerce in the Indian Ocean ever took them
      further than the Arabian coast, about E. Long. 55º.

</pre>
    <p>
      The most precious and useful of the metals lie, in many places, so near
      the earth&rsquo;s surface that, in the earliest times, mining is unneeded and
      therefore unpractised. We are told that in Spain silver was first
      discovered in consequence of a great fire, which consumed all the forests
      wherewith the mountains were clothed, and lasted many days; at the end of
      which time the surface of the soil was found to be intersected by streams
      of silver from the melting of the superficial silver ore through the
      intense heat of the conflagration. The natives did not know what to do
      with the metal, so they bartered it away to the Phoenician traders, who
      already frequented their country, in return for some wares of very
      moderate value.<a href="#linknote-101" name="linknoteref-101"
       id="linknoteref-101">101</a> Whether this tale be true or no, it is
      certain that even at the present day, in what are called &ldquo;new countries,&rdquo;
       valuable metals often show themselves on the surface of the soil, either
      in the form of metalliferous earths, or of rocks which shine with spangles
      of a metallic character, or occasionally, though rarely, of actual masses
      of pure ore, sometimes encrusted with an oxide, sometimes bare, bright,
      and unmistakable. In modern times, whenever there is a rush into any gold
      region&mdash;whether California, or Australia, or South Africa&mdash;the
      early yield is from the surface. The first comers scratch the ground with
      a knife or with a pick-axe, and are rewarded by discovering &ldquo;nuggets&rdquo; of
      greater or less dimensions; the next flight of gold-finders search the
      beds of the streams; and it is not until the supply from these two sources
      begins to fail that mining, in the proper sense of the term, is attempted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The earliest mining operations, whereof we have any record, are those
      conducted by the Egyptian kings of the fourth, fifth and twelfth
      dynasties, in the Sinaitic region. At two places in the mountains between
      Suez and Mount Sinai, now known as the Wady Magharah and
      Sarabit-el-Khadim, copper was extracted from the bosom of the earth by
      means of shafts laboriously excavated in the rocks, under the auspices of
      these early Pharaohs.<a href="#linknote-102" name="linknoteref-102"
       id="linknoteref-102">102</a> Hence at the time of the Exodus the process
      of mining was familiar to the Hebrews, who could thus fully appreciate the
      promise,<a href="#linknote-103" name="linknoteref-103" id="linknoteref-103">103</a>
      that they were about to be given &ldquo;a good land&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;a land whose stones
      were iron, and out of whose hills they might <i>dig brass</i>.&rdquo; The
      Phoenicians, probably, derived their first knowledge of mining from their
      communications with the Egyptians, and no doubt first practised the art
      within the limits of their own territory&mdash;in Lebanon, Casius, and
      Bargylus. The mineral stores of these regions were, however, but scanty,
      and included none of the more important metals, excepting iron. The
      Phoenicians were thus very early in their history driven afield for the
      supply of their needs, and among the principal causes of their first
      voyages of discovery must be placed the desire of finding and occupying
      regions which contained the metallic treasures wherein their own proper
      country was deficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is probable that they first commenced mining operations on a large
      scale in Cyprus. Here, according to Pliny,<a href="#linknote-104"
       name="linknoteref-104" id="linknoteref-104">104</a> copper was first
      discovered; and though this may be a fable, yet here certainly it was
      found in great abundance at a very early time, and was worked to such an
      extent, that the Greeks knew copper, as distinct from bronze, by no other
      name than that of {khalkos Kuprios}, whence the Roman <i>Æs Cyprium</i>,
      and our own name for the metal. The principal mines were in the southern
      mountain range, near Tamasus,<a href="#linknote-105" name="linknoteref-105"
       id="linknoteref-105">105</a> but there were others also at Amathus, Soli,
      and Curium.<a href="#linknote-106" name="linknoteref-106"
       id="linknoteref-106">106</a> Some of the old workings have been noticed by
      modern travellers, particularly near Soli and Tamasus,<a
      href="#linknote-107" name="linknoteref-107" id="linknoteref-107">107</a>
      but they have neither been described anciently nor examined scientifically
      in modern times. The ore from which the metal was extracted is called <i>chalcitis</i>
      by Pliny,<a href="#linknote-108" name="linknoteref-108"
       id="linknoteref-108">108</a> and may have been the &ldquo;chalcocite&rdquo; of our
      present metallurgical science, which is a sulphide containing very nearly
      eighty per cent. of copper. The brief account which Strabo gives of the
      mines of Tamasus shows that the ore was smelted in furnaces which were
      heated by wood fires. We gather also from Strabo that Tamasus had silver
      mines.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the Phoenicians conducted mining operations in Thasos we know from
      Herodotus,<a href="#linknote-109" name="linknoteref-109"
       id="linknoteref-109">109</a> and from other writers of repute<a
      href="#linknote-1010" name="linknoteref-1010" id="linknoteref-1010">1010</a>
      we learn that they extended these operations to the mainland opposite.
      Herodotus had himself visited Thasos, and tells us that the mines were on
      the eastern coast of the island, between two places which he calls
      respectively Ænyra and Coenyra. The metal sought was gold, and in their
      quest of it the Phoenicians had, he says, turned an entire mountain
      topsy-turvy. Here again no modern researches seem to have been made, and
      nothing more is known than that at present the natives obtain no gold from
      their soil, do not seek for it, and are even ignorant that their island
      was ever a gold-producing region.<a href="#linknote-1011"       name="linknoteref-1011" id="linknoteref-1011">1011</a> The case is almost
      the same on the opposite coast, where in ancient times very rich mines
      both of gold and silver abounded,<a href="#linknote-1012"       name="linknoteref-1012" id="linknoteref-1012">1012</a> which the
      Phoenicians are said to have worked, but where at the present day mining
      enterprise is almost at a standstill, and only a very small quantity of
      silver is produced.<a href="#linknote-1013" name="linknoteref-1013"       id="linknoteref-1013">1013</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sardinia can scarcely have been occupied by the Phoenicians for anything
      but its metals. The southern and south-western parts of the island, where
      they made their settlements, were rich in copper and lead; and the
      position of the cities seems to indicate the intention to appropriate
      these metals. In the vicinity of the lead mines are enormous heaps of
      scoriæ, mounting up apparently to a very remote era.<a
      href="#linknote-1014" name="linknoteref-1014" id="linknoteref-1014">1014</a>
      The scoriæ are not so numerous in the vicinity of the copper mines, but
      &ldquo;pigs&rdquo; of copper have been found in the island, unlike any of the Roman
      period, which are perhaps Phoenician, and furnish specimens of the
      castings into which the metal was run, after it had been fused and to some
      extent refined. The weight of the pigs is from twenty-eight to
      thirty-seven kilogrammes.<a href="#linknote-1015" name="linknoteref-1015"       id="linknoteref-1015">1015</a> Pigs of lead have also been found, but they
      are less frequent.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all the other mining operations of the Phoenicians were insignificant
      compared with those of which the theatre was Spain. Spain was the Peru of
      the ancient world, and surpassed its modern rival, in that it produced not
      only gold and silver, but also copper, iron, tin, and lead. Of these
      metals gold was the least abundant. It was found, however, as gold dust in
      the bed of the Tagus;<a href="#linknote-1016" name="linknoteref-1016"       id="linknoteref-1016">1016</a> and there were mines of it in Gallicia,<a
      href="#linknote-1017" name="linknoteref-1017" id="linknoteref-1017">1017</a>
      in the Asturias, and elsewhere. There was always some silver mixed with
      it, but in one of the Gallician mines the proportion was less than three
      per cent. Elsewhere the proportion reached to ten or even twelve and a
      half per cent.; and, as there was no known mode of clearing the gold from
      it, the produce of the Gallician mine was in high esteem and greatly
      preferred to that of any other. Silver was yielded in very large
      quantities. &ldquo;Spain,&rdquo; says Diodorus Siculus,<a href="#linknote-1018"       name="linknoteref-1018" id="linknoteref-1018">1018</a> &ldquo;has the best and
      most plentiful silver from mines of all the world.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Spanish silver,&rdquo;
       says Pliny,<a href="#linknote-1019" name="linknoteref-1019"       id="linknoteref-1019">1019</a> &ldquo;is the best.&rdquo; When the Phoenicians first
      visited Spain, they found the metal held in no esteem at all by the
      natives. It was the common material of the cheapest drinking vessels, and
      was readily parted with for almost anything that the merchants chose to
      offer. Much of it was superficial, but the veins were found to run to a
      great depth; and the discovery of one vein was a sure index of the near
      vicinity of more.<a href="#linknote-1020" name="linknoteref-1020"       id="linknoteref-1020">1020</a> The out-put of the Spanish silver mines
      during the Phoenician, Carthaginian, and Roman periods was enormous, and
      cannot be calculated; nor has the supply even yet failed altogether. The
      iron and copper of Spain are also said to have been exceedingly abundant
      in ancient times,<a href="#linknote-1021" name="linknoteref-1021"       id="linknoteref-1021">1021</a> though, owing to the inferior value of the
      metals, and to their wider distribution, but little is recorded with
      regard to them. Its tin and lead, on the other hand, as being metals found
      in comparatively few localities, receive not infrequent mention. The
      Spanish tin, according to Posidonius, did not crop out upon the surface,<a
      href="#linknote-1022" name="linknoteref-1022" id="linknoteref-1022">1022</a>
      but had to be obtained by mining. It was produced in some considerable
      quantity in the country of the Artabri, to the north of Lusitania,<a
      href="#linknote-1023" name="linknoteref-1023" id="linknoteref-1023">1023</a>
      as well as in Lusitania itself, and in Gallicia;<a href="#linknote-1024"       name="linknoteref-1024" id="linknoteref-1024">1024</a> but was found
      chiefly in small particles intermixed with a dark sandy earth. Lead was
      yielded in greater abundance; it was found in Cantabria, in Bætica, and
      many other places.<a href="#linknote-1025" name="linknoteref-1025"       id="linknoteref-1025">1025</a> Much of it was mixed with silver, and was
      obtained in the course of the operations by means of which silver was
      smelted and refined.<a href="#linknote-1026" name="linknoteref-1026"       id="linknoteref-1026">1026</a> The mixed metal was called <i>galena</i>.<a
      href="#linknote-1027" name="linknoteref-1027" id="linknoteref-1027">1027</a>
      Lead, however, was also found, either absolutely pure,<a
      href="#linknote-1028" name="linknoteref-1028" id="linknoteref-1028">1028</a>
      or so nearly so that the alloy was inappreciable, and was exported in
      large quantities, both by the Phoenicians and the Carthaginians, and also
      by the Romans. It was believed that the metal had a power of growth and
      reproduction, so that if a mine was deserted for a while and then
      re-opened, it was sure to be found more productive than it was previously.<a
      href="#linknote-1029" name="linknoteref-1029" id="linknoteref-1029">1029</a>
      The fact seems to be simply that the supply is inexhaustible, since even
      now Spain furnishes more than half the lead that is consumed by the rest
      of Europe. Besides the ordinary metals, Spain was capable of yielding an
      abundance of quicksilver;<a href="#linknote-1030" name="linknoteref-1030"       id="linknoteref-1030">1030</a> but this metal seems not to have attracted
      the attention of the Phoenicians, who had no use for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The methods employed by the Phoenicians to obtain the metals which they
      coveted were not, on the whole, unlike those which continue in use at the
      present day. Where surface gold was brought down by the streams, the
      ground in their vicinity, and such portions of their beds as could be laid
      bare, were searched by the spade; any earth or sand that was seen to be
      auriferous was carefully dug out and washed, till the earthy particles
      were cleared away, and only the gold remained. Where the metal lay deeper,
      perpendicular shafts were sunk into the ground to a greater or less depth&mdash;sometimes,
      if we may believe Diodorus,<a href="#linknote-1031" name="linknoteref-1031"       id="linknoteref-1031">1031</a> to the depth of half a mile or more; from
      these shafts horizontal adits were carried out at various levels, and from
      the adits there branched lateral galleries, sometimes at right angles,
      sometimes obliquely, which pursued either a straight or a tortuous course.<a
      href="#linknote-1032" name="linknoteref-1032" id="linknoteref-1032">1032</a>
      The veins of metal were perseveringly followed up, and where faults
      occurred in them, filled with trap,<a href="#linknote-1033"       name="linknoteref-1033" id="linknoteref-1033">1033</a> or other hard rock,
      the obstacle was either tunnelled through or its flank turned, and the
      vein still pursued on the other side. As the danger of a fall of material
      from the roofs of the adits and galleries was well understood, it was
      customary to support them by means of wooden posts, or, where the material
      was sufficiently firm, to arch them.<a href="#linknote-1034"       name="linknoteref-1034" id="linknoteref-1034">1034</a> Still, from time to
      time, falls would occur, with great injury and loss of life to the miners.
      Nor was there much less danger where a mountain was quarried for the sake
      of its metallic treasures. Here, too, galleries were driven into the
      mountain-side, and portions of it so loosened that after a time they
      detached themselves and fell with a loud crash into a mass of <i>débris</i>.<a
      href="#linknote-1035" name="linknoteref-1035" id="linknoteref-1035">1035</a>
      It sometimes happened that, as the workings proceeded, subterranean
      springs were tapped, which threatened to flood the mine, and put an end to
      its further utilisation. In such cases, wherever it was possible, tunnels
      were constructed, and the water drained off to a lower level.<a
      href="#linknote-1036" name="linknoteref-1036" id="linknoteref-1036">1036</a>
      In the deeper mines this, of course, could not be done, and such workings
      had to be abandoned, until the invention of the Archimedes&rsquo; screw (ab.
      B.C. 220-190), when the water was pumped up to the surface, and so got rid
      of.<a href="#linknote-1037" name="linknoteref-1037" id="linknoteref-1037">1037</a>
      But before this date Phoenicia had ceased to exist as an independent
      country, and the mines that had once been hers were either no longer
      worked, or had passed into the hands of the Romans or the Carthaginians.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the various ores were obtained, they were first of all crushed, then
      pounded to a paste; after which, by frequent washings, the non-metallic
      elements were to a large extent eliminated, and the metallic ones alone
      left. These, being collected, were placed in crucibles of white clay,<a
      href="#linknote-1038" name="linknoteref-1038" id="linknoteref-1038">1038</a>
      which were then submitted to the action of a furnace heated to the melting
      point. This point could only be reached by the use of the bellows. When it
      was reached, the impurities which floated on the top of the molten metal
      were skimmed off, or the metal itself allowed, by the turning of a cock,
      to flow from an upper crucible into a lower one. For greater purity the
      melting and skimming process was sometimes repeated; and, in the case of
      gold, the skimmings were themselves broken up, pounded, and again
      submitted to the melting pot.<a href="#linknote-1039"       name="linknoteref-1039" id="linknoteref-1039">1039</a> The use of
      quicksilver, however, being unknown, the gold was never wholly freed from
      the alloy of silver always found in it, nor was the silver ever wholly
      freed from an alloy of lead.<a href="#linknote-1040"       name="linknoteref-1040" id="linknoteref-1040">1040</a>

      The Romans and Carthaginians worked their mines almost wholly by slave
      labour; and very painful pictures are drawn of the sufferings undergone by
      the unhappy victims of a barbarous and wasteful system.<a
      href="#linknote-1041" name="linknoteref-1041" id="linknoteref-1041">1041</a>
      The gangs of slaves, we are told, remained in the mines night and day,
      never seeing the sun, but living and dying in the murky and foetid
      atmosphere of the deep excavations. It can scarcely be hoped that the
      Phoenicians were wiser or more merciful. They had a large command of slave
      labour, and would naturally employ it where the work to be done was
      exceptionally hard and disagreeable. Moreover, the Carthaginians, their
      colonists, are likely to have kept up the system, whatever it was, which
      they found established on succeeding to the inheritance of the Phoenician
      mines, and the fact that they worked them by means of slaves makes it more
      than probable that the Phoenicians had done so before them.<a

      When the metals were regarded as sufficiently cleansed from impurities,
      they were run into moulds, which took the form of bars, pigs, or ingots.
      Pigs of copper and lead have, as already observed, been found in Sardinia
      which may well belong to Phoenician times. There is also in the museum of
      Truro a pig of tin, which, as it differs from those made by the Romans,
      Normans, and later workers, has been supposed to be Phoenician.<a
      href="#linknote-1043" name="linknoteref-1043" id="linknoteref-1043">1043</a>
      Ingots of gold and silver have not at present been found on Phoenician
      localities; but the Persian practice, witnessed to by Herodotus,<a
      href="#linknote-1044" name="linknoteref-1044" id="linknoteref-1044">1044</a>
      was probably adopted from the subject nation, which confessedly surpassed
      all the others in the useful arts, in commerce, and in practical sagacity.

</pre>
    <p>
      There can be no doubt that the Phoenicians were a people in whose minds
      religion and religious ideas occupied a very prominent place.
      Religiousness has been said to be one of the leading characteristics of
      the Semitic race;<a href="#linknote-0111" name="linknoteref-0111"       id="linknoteref-0111">0111</a> and it is certainly remarkable that with
      that race originated the three principal religions, two of which are the
      only progressive religions, of the modern world. Judaism, Christianity,
      and Mohammedanism all arose in Western Asia within a restricted area, and
      from nations whose Semitic origin is unmistakable. The subject of ethnic
      affinities and differences, of the transmission of qualities and
      characteristics, is exceedingly obscure; but, if the theory of heredity be
      allowed any weight at all, there should be no difficulty in accepting the
      view that particular races of mankind have special leanings and aptitudes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, the religiousness of the Phoenicians does not rest on any <i>à
      priori</i> arguments, or considerations of what is likely to have been.
      Here was a nation among whom, in every city, the temple was the centre of
      attraction, and where the piety of the citizens adorned every temple with
      abundant and costly offerings. The monarchs who were at the head of the
      various states showed the greatest zeal in continually maintaining the
      honour of the gods, repaired and beautified the sacred buildings, and
      occasionally added to their kingly dignity the highly esteemed office of
      High Priest.<a href="#linknote-0112" name="linknoteref-0112"       id="linknoteref-0112">0112</a> The coinage of the country bore religious
      emblems,<a href="#linknote-0113" name="linknoteref-0113"       id="linknoteref-0113">0113</a> and proclaimed the fact that the cities
      regarded themselves as under the protection of this or that deity. Both
      the kings and their subjects bore commonly religious names&mdash;names
      which designated them as the worshippers or placed them under the tutelage
      of some god or goddess. Abd-alonim, Abdastartus, Abd-osiris, Abdemon
      (which is properly Abd-Esmun), Abdi-milkut, were names of the former kind,
      Abi-baal (= &ldquo;Baal is my father&rdquo;), Itho-bal (= &ldquo;with him is Baal&rdquo;),
      Baleazar or Baal-azur (= &ldquo;Baal protects&rdquo;), names of the latter. The
      Phoenician ships carried images of the gods<a href="#linknote-0114"       name="linknoteref-0114" id="linknoteref-0114">0114</a> in the place of
      figure-heads. Wherever the Phoenicians went, they bore with them their
      religion and their worship; in each colony they planted a temple or
      temples, and everywhere throughout their wide dominion the same gods were
      worshipped with the same rites and with the same observances.
    </p>
    <p>
      In considering the nature of the Phoenician religion, we must distinguish
      between its different stages. There is sufficient reason to believe that
      originally, either when they first occupied their settlements upon the
      Mediterranean or before they moved from their primitive seats upon the
      shores of the Persian Gulf, the Phoenicians were Monotheists. We must not
      look for information on this subject to the pretentious work which Philo
      of Byblus, in the first or second century of our era, put forth with
      respect to the &ldquo;Origines&rdquo; of his countrymen, and attributed to
      Sanchoniatho;<a href="#linknote-0115" name="linknoteref-0115"       id="linknoteref-0115">0115</a> we must rather look to the evidence of
      language and fact, records which may indeed be misread, but which cannot
      well be forged or falsified. These will show us that in the earliest times
      the religious sentiment of the Phoenicians acknowledged only a single
      deity&mdash;a single mighty power, which was supreme over the whole
      universe. The names by which they designated him were El, &ldquo;great;&rdquo; Ram or
      Rimmon, &ldquo;high;&rdquo; Baal, &ldquo;Lord;&rdquo; Melek or Molech, &ldquo;King;&rdquo; Eliun, &ldquo;Supreme;&rdquo;
       Adonai, &ldquo;My Lord;&rdquo; Bel-samin, &ldquo;Lord of Heaven,&rdquo; and the like.<a
      href="#linknote-0116" name="linknoteref-0116" id="linknoteref-0116">0116</a>
      Distinct deities could no more be intended by such names as these than by
      those under which God is spoken of in the Hebrew Scriptures, several of
      them identical with the Phoenician names&mdash;El or Elohim, &ldquo;great;&rdquo;
       Jehovah, &ldquo;existing;&rdquo; Adonai, &ldquo;my Lord;&rdquo; Shaddai, &ldquo;strong;&rdquo; El Eliun,<a
      href="#linknote-0117" name="linknoteref-0117" id="linknoteref-0117">0117</a>
      &ldquo;the supreme Great One.&rdquo; How far the Phoenicians actually realised all
      that their names properly imply, whether they went so far as to divest God
      wholly of a material nature, whether they viewed Him as the Creator, as
      well as the Lord, of the world, are problems which it is impossible, with
      the means at present at our disposal, to solve. But they certainly viewed
      Him as &ldquo;the Lord of Heaven,"<a href="#linknote-0118"       name="linknoteref-0118" id="linknoteref-0118">0118</a> and, if so, no
      doubt also as the Lord of earth; they believed Him to be &ldquo;supreme&rdquo; or &ldquo;the
      Most High;&rdquo; and they realised his personal relation to each one of his
      worshippers, who were privileged severally to address Him as Adonai&mdash;&ldquo;<i>my</i>
      Lord.&rdquo; It may be presumed that at this early stage of the religion there
      was no idolatry; when One God alone is acknowledged and recognised, the
      feeling is naturally that expressed in the Egyptian hymn of praise&mdash;&ldquo;He
      is not graven in marble; He is not beheld; His abode is unknown; there is
      no building that can contain Him; unknown is his name in heaven; He doth
      not manifest his forms; vain are all representations."<a
      href="#linknote-0119" name="linknoteref-0119" id="linknoteref-0119">0119</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      But this happy state of things did not&mdash;perhaps we may say, could not&mdash;in
      the early condition of the human intelligence, last long. Fallen man, left
      to himself, very soon corrupts his way upon the earth; his hands deal with
      wickedness; and, in a little while, &ldquo;every imagination of the thoughts of
      his heart is only evil continually."<a href="#linknote-1110"       name="linknoteref-1110" id="linknoteref-1110">1110</a> When he becomes
      conscious to himself of sin, he ceases to be able to endure the thought of
      One Perfect Infinite Being, omnipotent, ever-present, who reads his heart,
      who is &ldquo;about his path, and about his bed, and spies out all his ways."<a
      href="#linknote-1111" name="linknoteref-1111" id="linknoteref-1111">1111</a>
      He instinctively catches at anything whereby he may be relieved from the
      intolerable burden of such a thought; and here the imperfection of
      language comes to his aid. As he has found it impossible to express in any
      one word all that is contained in his idea of the Divine Being, he has
      been forced to give Him many names, each of them originally expressive of
      some one of that Being&rsquo;s attributes. But in course of time these words
      have lost their force&mdash;their meaning has been forgotten&mdash;and
      they have come to be mere proper names, designative but not significative.
      Here is material for the perverted imagination to work upon. A separate
      being is imagined answering to each of the names; and so the <i>nomina</i>
      become <i>numina</i>.<a href="#linknote-1112" name="linknoteref-1112"       id="linknoteref-1112">1112</a> Many gods are substituted for one; and the
      idea of God is instantly lowered. The gods have different spheres. No god
      is infinite; none is omnipotent, none omnipresent; therefore none
      omniscient. The aweful, terrible nature of God is got rid of, and a
      company of angelic beings takes its place, none of them very alarming to
      the conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      In its second stage the religion of Phoenicia was a polytheism, less
      multitudinous than most others, and one in which the several divinities
      were not distinguished from one another by very marked or striking
      features. At the head of the Pantheon stood a god and a goddess&mdash;Baal
      and Ashtoreth. Baal, &ldquo;the Lord,&rdquo; or Baal-samin,<a href="#linknote-1113"       name="linknoteref-1113" id="linknoteref-1113">1113</a> &ldquo;the Lord of
      Heaven,&rdquo; was compared by the Greeks to their Zeus, and by the Romans to
      their Jupiter. Mythologically, he was only one among many gods, but
      practically he stood alone; he was the chief of the gods, the main object
      of worship, and the great ruler and protector of the Phoenician people.
      Sometimes, but not always, he had a solar character, and was represented
      with his head encircled by rays.<a href="#linknote-1114"       name="linknoteref-1114" id="linknoteref-1114">1114</a> Baalbek, which was
      dedicated to him, was properly &ldquo;the city of the Sun,&rdquo; and was called by
      the Greeks Heliopolis. The solar character of Baal is, however, far from
      predominant, and as early as the time of Josiah we find the Sun worshipped
      separately from him,<a href="#linknote-1115" name="linknoteref-1115"       id="linknoteref-1115">1115</a> no doubt under a different name. Baal is,
      to a considerable extent, a city god. Tyre especially was dedicated to
      him; and we hear of the &ldquo;Baal of Tyre"<a href="#linknote-1116"       name="linknoteref-1116" id="linknoteref-1116">1116</a> and again of the
      &ldquo;Baal of Tarsus."<a href="#linknote-1117" name="linknoteref-1117"       id="linknoteref-1117">1117</a> Essentially, he was the embodiment of the
      generative principle in nature&mdash;&ldquo;the god of the creative power,
      bringing all things to life everywhere."<a href="#linknote-1118"       name="linknoteref-1118" id="linknoteref-1118">1118</a> Hence, &ldquo;his statue
      rode upon bulls, for the bull was the symbol of generative power; and he
      was also represented with bunches of grapes and pomegranates in his hand,"<a
      href="#linknote-1119" name="linknoteref-1119" id="linknoteref-1119">1119</a>
      emblems of productivity. The sacred conical stones and pillars dedicated
      in his temples<a href="#linknote-1120" name="linknoteref-1120"       id="linknoteref-1120">1120</a> may have had their origin in a similar
      symbolism. As polytheistic systems had always a tendency to enlarge
      themselves, Baal had no sooner become a separate god, distinct from El,
      and Rimmon, and Molech, and Adonai, than he proceeded to multiply himself,
      and from Baal became Baalim,<a href="#linknote-1121"       name="linknoteref-1121" id="linknoteref-1121">1121</a> either because the
      local Baals&mdash;Baal-Tzur, Baal-Sidon, Baal-Tars, Baal-Libnan,
      Baal-Hermon&mdash;were conceived of as separate deities, or because the
      aspects of Baal&mdash;Baal as Sun-God, Baal as Lord of Heaven, Baal as
      lord of flies,<a href="#linknote-1122" name="linknoteref-1122"       id="linknoteref-1122">1122</a>, &amp;c.&mdash;were so viewed, and grew to
      be distinct objects of worship. In later times he was identified with the
      Egyptian Ammon, and worshipped as Baal-Hammon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baal is known to have had temples at Baalbek, at Tyre, at Tarsus, at
      Agadir<a href="#linknote-1123" name="linknoteref-1123"       id="linknoteref-1123">1123</a> (Gades), in Sardinia,<a
      href="#linknote-1124" name="linknoteref-1124" id="linknoteref-1124">1124</a>
      at Carthage, and at Ekron. Though not at first worshipped under a visible
      form, he came to have statues dedicated to him,<a href="#linknote-1125"       name="linknoteref-1125" id="linknoteref-1125">1125</a> which received the
      usual honours. Sometimes, as already observed, his head was encircled with
      a representation of the solar rays; sometimes his form was assimilated to
      that under which the Egyptians of later times worshipped their Ammon.
      Seated upon a throne and wrapped in a long robe, he presented the
      appearance of a man in the flower of his age, bearded, and of solemn
      aspect, with the carved horn of a ram on either side of his forehead.
      Figures of rams also supported the arms of his throne on either side, and
      on the heads of these two supports his hands rested.<a
      href="#linknote-1126" name="linknoteref-1126" id="linknoteref-1126">1126</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The female deity whose place corresponded to that of Baal in the
      Phoenician Pantheon, and who was in a certain sense his companion and
      counterpart, was Ashtoreth or Astarte. As Baal was the embodiment of the
      generative principle in nature, so was Ashtoreth of the receptive and
      productive principle. She was the great nature-goddess, the Magna Mater,
      regent of the stars, queen of heaven, giver of life, and source of woman&rsquo;s
      fecundity.<a href="#linknote-1127" name="linknoteref-1127"       id="linknoteref-1127">1127</a> Just as Baal had a solar, so she had a
      lunar aspect, being pictured with horns upon her head representative of
      the lunar crescent.<a href="#linknote-1128" name="linknoteref-1128"       id="linknoteref-1128">1128</a> Hence, as early as the time of Moses, there
      was a city on the eastern side of Jordan, named after her,
      Ashtoreth-Karnaim,<a href="#linknote-1129" name="linknoteref-1129"       id="linknoteref-1129">1129</a> or &ldquo;Astarte of the two horns.&rdquo; Her images
      are of many forms. Most commonly she appears as a naked female, with long
      hair, sometimes gathered into tresses, and with her two hands supporting
      her two breasts.<a href="#linknote-1130" name="linknoteref-1130"       id="linknoteref-1130">1130</a> Occasionally she is a mother, seated in a
      comfortable chair, and nursing her babe.<a href="#linknote-1131"       name="linknoteref-1131" id="linknoteref-1131">1131</a> Now and then she is
      draped, and holds a dove to her breast, or else she takes an attitude of
      command, with the right hand raised, as if to bespeak attention.
      Sometimes, on the contrary, her figure has that modest and retiring
      attitude which has caused it to be described by a distinguished
      archæologist<a href="#linknote-1132" name="linknoteref-1132"       id="linknoteref-1132">1132</a> as &ldquo;the Phoenician prototype of the Venus
      de Medici.&rdquo; The Greeks and Romans, who identified Baal determinately with
      their Zeus or Jupiter, found it very much more difficult to fix on any
      single goddess in their Pantheon as the correspondent of Astarte. Now they
      made her Hera or Juno, now Aphrodite or Venus, now Athene, now Artemis,
      now Selene, now Rhea or Cybele. But her aphrodisiac character was
      certainly the one in which she most frequently appeared. She was the
      goddess of the sexual passion, rarely, however, represented with the
      chaste and modest attributes of the Grecian Aphrodite-Urania, far more
      commonly with those coarser and more repulsive ones which characterise
      Aphrodite Pandemos.<a href="#linknote-1133" name="linknoteref-1133"       id="linknoteref-1133">1133</a> Her temples were numerous, though perhaps
      not quite so numerous as those of Baal. The most famous were those at
      Sidon, Aphaca, Ashtoreth-Karnaim, Paphos, Pessinus, and Carthage. At Sidon
      the kings were sometimes her high-priests;<a href="#linknote-1134"       name="linknoteref-1134" id="linknoteref-1134">1134</a> and her name is
      found as a frequent element in Phoenician personal names, royal and other:
      e.g.&mdash;Astartus, Abdastartus, Delæastartus, Am-ashtoreth, Bodoster,
      Bostor, &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other principal Phoenician deities were El, Melkarth, Dagon, Hadad,
      Adonis, Sydyk, Eshmun, the Cabeiri, Onca, Tanith, Tanata, or Anaitis, and
      Baalith, Baaltis, or Beltis. El, or Il, originally a name of the Supreme
      God, became in the later Phoenician mythology a separate and subordinate
      divinity, whom the Greeks compared to their Kronos<a href="#linknote-1135"       name="linknoteref-1135" id="linknoteref-1135">1135</a> and the Romans to
      their Saturn. El was the special god of Gebal or Byblus,<a
      href="#linknote-1136" name="linknoteref-1136" id="linknoteref-1136">1136</a>
      and was worshipped also with peculiar rites at Carthage.<a
      href="#linknote-1137" name="linknoteref-1137" id="linknoteref-1137">1137</a>
      He was reckoned the son of Uranus and the father of Beltis, to whom he
      delivered over as her especial charge the city of Byblus.<a
      href="#linknote-1138" name="linknoteref-1138" id="linknoteref-1138">1138</a>
      Numerous tales were told of him. While reigning on earth as king of
      Byblus, or king of Phoenicia, he had fallen in love with a nymph of the
      country, called Anobret, by whom he had a son named Ieoud. This son, much
      as he loved him, when great dangers from war threatened the land, he first
      invested with the emblems of royalty, and then sacrificed.<a
      href="#linknote-1139" name="linknoteref-1139" id="linknoteref-1139">1139</a>
      Uranus (Heaven) married his sister Ge (Earth), and Il or Kronos was the
      issue of this marriage, as also were Dagon, Bætylus, and Atlas. Ge, being
      dissatisfied with the conduct of her husband, induced her son Kronos to
      make war upon him, and Kronos, with the assistance of Hermes, overcame
      Uranus, and having driven him from his kingdom succeeded to the imperial
      power. Besides sacrificing Ieoud, Kronos murdered another of his sons
      called Sadid, and also a daughter whose name is not given. Among his wives
      were Astarte, Rhea, Dioné, Eimarmené, and Hora, of whom the first three
      were his sisters.<a href="#linknote-1140" name="linknoteref-1140"       id="linknoteref-1140">1140</a> There is no need to pursue this
      mythological tangle. If it meant anything to the initiated, the meaning is
      wholly lost; and the stories, gravely as they are related by the ancient
      historian, to the modern, who has no key to them, are almost wholly
      valueless.
    </p>

      Originally, Melkarth would seem to have been a mere epithet, representing
      one aspect of Baal. The word is formed from the two roots <i>melek</i> and
      <i>kartha</i><a href="#linknote-1141" name="linknoteref-1141"       id="linknoteref-1141">1141</a> (= Heb. <i>kiriath</i>, &ldquo;city&rdquo;), and means
      &ldquo;King of the City,&rdquo; or &ldquo;City King,&rdquo; which Baal was considered to be. But
      the two names in course of time drifted apart, and Melicertes, in Philo
      Byblius, has no connection at all with Baal-samin.<a href="#linknote-1142"       name="linknoteref-1142" id="linknoteref-1142">1142</a> The Greeks, who
      identified Baal with their Zeus, viewed Melkarth as corresponding to their
      Heracles, or Hercules; and the later Phoenicians, catching at this
      identification, represented Melkarth under the form of a huge muscular
      man, with a lion&rsquo;s skin and sometimes with a club.<a href="#linknote-1143"       name="linknoteref-1143" id="linknoteref-1143">1143</a> Melkarth was
      especially worshipped at Tyre, of which city he was the tutelary deity, at
      Thasos, and at Gades. Herodotus describes the temple of Hercules at Tyre,
      and attributes to it an antiquity of 2,300 years before his own time.<a
      href="#linknote-1144" name="linknoteref-1144" id="linknoteref-1144">1144</a>
      He also visited a temple dedicated to the same god at Thasos.<a
      href="#linknote-1145" name="linknoteref-1145" id="linknoteref-1145">1145</a>
      With Gades were connected the myths of Hercules&rsquo; expedition to the west,
      of his erection of the pillars, his defeat of Chrysaor of the golden
      sword, and his successful foray upon the flocks and herds of the triple
      Geryon.<a href="#linknote-1146" name="linknoteref-1146"       id="linknoteref-1146">1146</a> Whether these legends were Greek or
      Phoenician in origin is uncertain; but the Phoenicians, at any rate,
      adopted them, and here have been lately found on Phoenician sites
      representations both of Geryon himself,<a href="#linknote-1147"       name="linknoteref-1147" id="linknoteref-1147">1147</a> and the carrying
      off by Hercules of his cattle.<a href="#linknote-1148"       name="linknoteref-1148" id="linknoteref-1148">1148</a> The temple of
      Heracles at Gades is mentioned by Strabo<a href="#linknote-1149"       name="linknoteref-1149" id="linknoteref-1149">1149</a> and others. It was
      on the eastern side of the island, where the strait between the island and
      the continent was narrowest. Founded about B.C. 1100, it continued to
      stand to the time of Silius Italicus, and, according to the tradition, had
      never needed repair.<a href="#linknote-1150" name="linknoteref-1150"       id="linknoteref-1150">1150</a> An unextinguished fire had burnt upon its
      altar for thirteen hundred years; and the worship had remained unchanged&mdash;no
      image profaned the Holy of Holies, where the god dwelt, waited on by
      bare-footed priests with heads shaved, clothed in white linen robes, and
      vowed to celibacy.<a href="#linknote-1151" name="linknoteref-1151"       id="linknoteref-1151">1151</a> The name of the god occurs as an element in
      a certain small number of Phoenician names of men&mdash;e.g. Bomilcar,
      Himilcar, Abd-Melkarth, and the like.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagon appears in scripture only as a Philistine god,<a
      href="#linknote-1152" name="linknoteref-1152" id="linknoteref-1152">1152</a>
      which would not prove him to have been acknowledged by the Phoenicians;
      but as Philo of Byblus admits him among the primary Phoenician deities,
      making him a son of Uranus, and a brother of Il or Kronis,<a
      href="#linknote-1153" name="linknoteref-1153" id="linknoteref-1153">1153</a>
      it is perhaps right that he should be allowed a place in the Phoenician
      list. According to Philo, he was the god of agriculture, the discoverer of
      wheat, and the inventor of the plough.<a href="#linknote-1154"       name="linknoteref-1154" id="linknoteref-1154">1154</a> Whether he was
      really represented, as is commonly supposed,<a href="#linknote-1155"       name="linknoteref-1155" id="linknoteref-1155">1155</a> in the form of a
      fish, or as half man and half fish, is extremely doubtful. In the Hebrew
      account of the fall of Dagon&rsquo;s image before the Ark of the Covenant at
      Ashdod there is no mention made of any &ldquo;fishy part;&rdquo; nor is there anything
      in the Assyrian remains to connect the name Dagon, which occurs in them,
      with the remarkable figure of a fish-god so frequent in the bas-reliefs.
      That figure would seem rather to represent, or symbolise, either Hea or
      Nin. The notion of Dagon&rsquo;s fishy form seems to rest entirely on an
      etymological basis&mdash;on the fact, i.e. that <i>dag</i> means &ldquo;fish,&rdquo;
       in Hebrew. In Assyrian, however, <i>kha</i> is &ldquo;fish,&rdquo; and not <i>dag</i>;
      while in Hebrew, though <i>dag</i> is &ldquo;fish,&rdquo; <i>dagan</i> is &ldquo;corn.&rdquo; It
      may be noted also that the Phoenician remains contain no representation of
      a fish deity. On the whole, it is perhaps best to be content with the
      account of Philo, and to regard the Phoenician Dagon as a &ldquo;Zeus Arotrios&rdquo;&mdash;a
      god presiding over agriculture and especially worshipped by husbandmen.
      The name, however, does not occur in the Phoenician remains which have
      come down to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hadad, like Dagon, obtains his right to be included in the list of
      Phoenician deities solely from the place assigned to him by Philo.
      Otherwise he would naturally be viewed as an Aramean god, worshipped
      especially in Aram-Zobah, and in Syria of Damascus.<a href="#linknote-1156"       name="linknoteref-1156" id="linknoteref-1156">1156</a> In Syria, he was
      identified with the sun;<a href="#linknote-1157" name="linknoteref-1157"       id="linknoteref-1157">1157</a> and it is possible that in the Phoenician
      religion he was the Sun-God, worshipped (as we have seen) sometimes
      independently of Baal. His image was represented with the solar rays
      streaming down from it towards the earth, so as to indicate that the earth
      received from him all that made it fruitful and abundant.<a
      href="#linknote-1158" name="linknoteref-1158" id="linknoteref-1158">1158</a>
      Macrobius connects his name with the Hebrew <i>chad</i>, &ldquo;one;&rdquo; but this
      derivation is improbable.<a href="#linknote-1159" name="linknoteref-1159"       id="linknoteref-1159">1159</a> Philo gives him the title of &ldquo;King of
      Gods,&rdquo; and says that he reigned conjointly with Astarte and Demaroüs,<a
      href="#linknote-1160" name="linknoteref-1160" id="linknoteref-1160">1160</a>
      but this does not throw much light on the real Phoenician conception of
      him. The local name, Hadad-rimmon,<a href="#linknote-1161"       name="linknoteref-1161" id="linknoteref-1161">1161</a> may seem to connect
      him with the god Rimmon, likewise a Syrian deity,<a href="#linknote-1162"       name="linknoteref-1162" id="linknoteref-1162">1162</a> and it is quite
      conceivable that the two words may have been alternative names of the same
      god, just as Phoebus and Apollo were with the Greeks. We may conjecture
      that the Sun was worshipped under both names in Syria, while in Phoenicia
      Hadad was alone made use of. The worship of Baal as the Sun, which tended
      to prevail ever more and more, ousted Hadad from his place, and caused him
      to pass into oblivion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adonis was probably, like Hadad, originally a sun-god; but the myths
      connected with him gave him, at any rate in the late Phoenician times, a
      very distinct and definite personality. He was made the son of Cinryas, a
      mythic king of Byblus,<a href="#linknote-1163" name="linknoteref-1163"       id="linknoteref-1163">1163</a> and the husband of Astarte or Ashtoreth.
      One day, as he chased the wild boar in Lebanon, near the sources of the
      river of Byblus, the animal which he was hunting turned upon him, and so
      gored his thigh that he died of the wound. Henceforth he was mourned
      annually. At the turn of the summer solstice, the anniversary of his
      death, all the women of Byblus went in a wild procession to Aphaca, in the
      Lebanon, where his temple stood, and wept and wailed on account of his
      death. The river, which his blood had once actually stained, turned red to
      show its sympathy with the mourners, and was thought to flow with his
      blood afresh. After the &ldquo;weeping for Tammuz"<a href="#linknote-1164"       name="linknoteref-1164" id="linknoteref-1164">1164</a> had continued for a
      definite time, the mourning terminated with the burial of an image of the
      god in the sacred precinct. Next day Adonis was supposed to return to
      life; his image was disinterred and carried back to the temple with music
      and dances, and every circumstance of rejoicing.<a href="#linknote-1165"       name="linknoteref-1165" id="linknoteref-1165">1165</a> Wild orgies
      followed, and Aphaca became notorious for scenes to which it will be
      necessary to recur hereafter. The Adonis myth is generally explained as
      representing either the perpetually recurrent decay and recovery of
      nature, or the declension of the Sun as he moves from the summer to the
      winter constellations, and his subsequent return and reappearance in all
      his strength. But myths obtained a powerful hold on ancient imaginations,
      and the worshippers of Adonis probably in most cases forgot the symbolical
      character of his cult, and looked on him as a divine or heroic personage,
      who had actually gone through all the adventures ascribed to him in the
      legend. Hence the peculiarly local character of his worship, of which we
      find traces only at Byblus and at Jerusalem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sydyk, &ldquo;Justice,&rdquo; or, the &ldquo;Just One,"<a href="#linknote-1166"       name="linknoteref-1166" id="linknoteref-1166">1166</a> whose name
      corresponds to the Hebrew Zadok or Zedek, appears in the Phoenician
      mythology especially as the father of Esmun and the Cabeiri. Otherwise he
      is only known as the son of Magus (!) and the discoverer of salt.<a
      href="#linknote-1167" name="linknoteref-1167" id="linknoteref-1167">1167</a>
      It is perhaps his name which forms the final element in Melchizedek,
      Adoni-zedek,<a href="#linknote-1168" name="linknoteref-1168"       id="linknoteref-1168">1168</a> and the like. We have no evidence that he
      was really worshipped by the Phoenicians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Esmun, on the other hand, the son of Sydyk, would seem to have been an
      object of worship almost as much as any other deity. He was the special
      god of Berytus,<a href="#linknote-1169" name="linknoteref-1169"       id="linknoteref-1169">1169</a> but was honoured also in Cyprus, at Sidon,
      at Carthage, in Sardinia, and elsewhere.<a href="#linknote-1170"       name="linknoteref-1170" id="linknoteref-1170">1170</a> His name forms a
      frequent element in Phoenician names, royal and other:&mdash;e.g.
      Esmun-azar, Esmun-nathan, Han-Esmun, Netsib-Esmun, Abd-Esmun, &amp;c.
      According to Damascius,<a href="#linknote-1171" name="linknoteref-1171"       id="linknoteref-1171">1171</a> he was the eighth son of Sydyk, whence his
      name, and the chief of the Cabeiri. Whereas they were dwarfish and
      misshapen, he was a youth of most beautiful appearance, truly worthy of
      admiration. Like Adonis, he was fond of hunting in the woods that clothe
      the flanks of Lebanon, and there he was seen by Astronoë, the Phoenician
      goddess, the mother of the gods (in whom we cannot fail to recognise
      Astarte), who persecuted him with her attentions to such an extent that to
      escape her he was driven to the desperate resource of self-emasculation.
      Upon this the goddess, greatly grieved, called him Pæan, and by means of
      quickening warmth brought him back to life, and changed him from a man
      into a god, which he thenceforth remained. The Phoenicians called him
      Esmun, &ldquo;the eighth,&rdquo; but the Greeks worshipped him as Asclepius, the god
      of healing, who gave life and health to mankind. Some of the later
      Phoenicians regarded him as identical with the atmosphere, which, they
      said, was the chief source of health to man.<a href="#linknote-1172"       name="linknoteref-1172" id="linknoteref-1172">1172</a> But it is not
      altogether clear that the earlier Phoenicians attached to him any healing
      character.<a href="#linknote-1173" name="linknoteref-1173"       id="linknoteref-1173">1173</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The seven other Cabeiri, or &ldquo;Great Ones,&rdquo; equally with Esmun the sons of
      Sydyk, were dwarfish gods who presided over navigation,<a
      href="#linknote-1174" name="linknoteref-1174" id="linknoteref-1174">1174</a>
      and were the patrons of sailors and ships. The special seat of their
      worship in Phoenicia Proper was Berytus, but they were recognised also in
      several of the Phoenician settlements, as especially in Lemnos, Imbrus,
      and Samothrace.<a href="#linknote-1175" name="linknoteref-1175"       id="linknoteref-1175">1175</a> Ships were regarded as their invention,<a
      href="#linknote-1176" name="linknoteref-1176" id="linknoteref-1176">1176</a>
      and a sculptured image of some one or other of them was always placed on
      every Phoenician war-galley, either at the stern or stem of the vessel.<a
      href="#linknote-1177" name="linknoteref-1177" id="linknoteref-1177">1177</a>
      They were also viewed as presiding over metals and metallurgy,<a
      href="#linknote-1178" name="linknoteref-1178" id="linknoteref-1178">1178</a>
      having thus some points of resemblance to the Greek Hephæstus and the
      Latin Vulcan. Pigmy and misshapen gods belong to that fetishism which has
      always had charms for the Hamitic nations; and it may be suspected that
      the Phoenicians adopted the Cabeiri from their Canaanite predecessors, who
      were of the race of Ham.<a href="#linknote-1179" name="linknoteref-1179"       id="linknoteref-1179">1179</a> The connection between these pigmy deities
      and the Egyptian Phthah, or rather Phthah-Sokari, is unmistakable, and was
      perceived by Herodotus.<a href="#linknote-1180" name="linknoteref-1180"       id="linknoteref-1180">1180</a> Clay pigmy figurines found on Phoenician
      sites<a href="#linknote-1181" name="linknoteref-1181" id="linknoteref-1181">1181</a>
      very closely resemble the Egyptian images of that god; and the coins
      attributed to Cossura exhibit a similar dwarfish form, generally carrying
      a hammer in the right hand.<a href="#linknote-1182" name="linknoteref-1182"       id="linknoteref-1182">1182</a> An astral character has been attached by
      some writers to the Cabeiri,<a href="#linknote-1183"       name="linknoteref-1183" id="linknoteref-1183">1183</a> but chiefly on
      account of their number, which is scarcely a sufficient proof.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several Greek writers speak of a Phoenician goddess corresponding to the
      Grecian Athene,<a href="#linknote-1184" name="linknoteref-1184"       id="linknoteref-1184">1184</a> and some of them say that she was named
      Onga or Onca.<a href="#linknote-1185" name="linknoteref-1185"       id="linknoteref-1185">1185</a> The Phoenician remains give us no such
      name; but as Philo Byblius has an &ldquo;Athene&rdquo; among his Phoenician deities,
      whom he makes the daughter of Il, or Kronos, and the queen of Attica,<a
      href="#linknote-1186" name="linknoteref-1186" id="linknoteref-1186">1186</a>
      it is perhaps best to allow Onca to retain her place in the Phoenician
      Pantheon. Philo says that Kronos <i>by her advice</i> shaped for himself
      out of iron a sword and a spear; we may therefore presume that she was a
      war-goddess (as was Pallas-Athene among the Greeks), whence she naturally
      presided over the gates of towns,<a href="#linknote-1187"       name="linknoteref-1187" id="linknoteref-1187">1187</a> which were built
      and fortified for warlike purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worship of a goddess, called Tanath or Tanith, by the later
      Phoenicians, is certain, since, besides the evidence furnished by the name
      Abd-Tanith, i.e. &ldquo;Servant of Tanith,"<a href="#linknote-1188"       name="linknoteref-1188" id="linknoteref-1188">1188</a> the name Tanith
      itself is distinctly read on a number of votive tablets brought from
      Carthage, in a connection which clearly implies her recognition, not only
      as a goddess, but as a great goddess, the principal object of Carthaginian
      worship. The form of inscription on the tablets is, ordinarily, as
      follows:&mdash;<a href="#linknote-1189" name="linknoteref-1189"       id="linknoteref-1189">1189</a>
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;To the great [goddess], Tanith, and
     To our lord and master Baal-Hammon.
     The offerer is ....,
     Son of ...., son of ....&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Tanith is invariable placed before Baal, as though superior to him, and
      can be no other than the celestial goddess (Dea coelestis), whose temple
      in the Roman Carthage was so celebrated.<a href="#linknote-1190"       name="linknoteref-1190" id="linknoteref-1190">1190</a> The Greeks regarded
      her as equivalent to their Artemis;<a href="#linknote-1191"       name="linknoteref-1191" id="linknoteref-1191">1191</a> the Romans made her
      Diana, or Juno, or Venus.<a href="#linknote-1192" name="linknoteref-1192"       id="linknoteref-1192">1192</a> Practically she must at Carthage have taken
      the place of Ashtoreth. Apuleius describes her as having a lunar
      character, like Ashtoreth, and calls her &ldquo;the parent of all things, the
      mistress of the elements, the initial offspring of the ages, the highest
      of the deities, the queen of the Manes, the first of the celestials, the
      single representative of all the gods and goddesses, the one divinity whom
      all the world worships in many shapes, with varied rites, and under a
      multitude of names."<a href="#linknote-1193" name="linknoteref-1193"       id="linknoteref-1193">1193</a> He says that she was represented as riding
      upon a lion, and it is probably her form which appears upon some of the
      later coins of Carthage, as well as upon a certain number of gems.<a
      href="#linknote-1194" name="linknoteref-1194" id="linknoteref-1194">1194</a>
      The origin of the name is uncertain. Gesenius would connect it at once
      with the Egyptian Neith (Nit), and with the Syrian Anaïtis or Tanaïtis;<a
      href="#linknote-1195" name="linknoteref-1195" id="linknoteref-1195">1195</a>
      but the double identification is scarcely tenable, since Anaïtis was, in
      Egypt, not Neith, but Anta.<a href="#linknote-1196" name="linknoteref-1196"       id="linknoteref-1196">1196</a> The subject is very obscure, and requires
      further investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baaltis, or Beltis, was, according to Philo Byblius, the daughter of
      Uranus and the sister of Asthoreth or Astarte.<a href="#linknote-1197"       name="linknoteref-1197" id="linknoteref-1197">1197</a> Il made her one of
      his many wives, and put the city of Byblus, which he had founded, under
      her special protection.<a href="#linknote-1198" name="linknoteref-1198"       id="linknoteref-1198">1198</a> It is doubtful, however, whether she was
      really viewed by the Phoenicians as a separate goddess, and not rather as
      Ashtoreth under another name. The word is the equivalent of {...}, &ldquo;my
      lady,&rdquo; a very suitable title for the supreme goddess. Beltis, indeed, in
      Babylonia, was distinct from Ishtar;<a href="#linknote-1199"       name="linknoteref-1199" id="linknoteref-1199">1199</a> but this fact must
      not be regarded as any sufficient proof that the case was the same in
      Phoenicia. The Phoenician polytheism was decidedly more restricted than
      the Babylonian, and did not greatly affect the needless multiplication of
      divinities. Baaltis in Phoenicia may be the Beltis of Babylon imported at
      a comparatively late date into the country, but is more probably an
      alternative name, or rather, perhaps, a mere honorary title of Ashtoreth.<a
      href="#linknote-11100" name="linknoteref-11100" id="linknoteref-11100">11100</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief characteristic of the third period of the Phoenician religion
      was the syncretistic tendency,<a href="#linknote-11101"       name="linknoteref-11101" id="linknoteref-11101">11101</a> whereby foreign
      gods were called in, and either identified with the old national
      divinities, or joined with them, and set by their side. Ammon, Osiris,
      Phthah, Pasht, and Athor, were introduced from Egypt, Tanith from either
      Egypt or Syria, Nergal from Assyria, Beltis (Baaltis) perhaps from

      and is represented on coins with Phoenician legends, which are attributed
      either to Malta or Gaulos.<a href="#linknote-11103"       name="linknoteref-11103" id="linknoteref-11103">11103</a> Osiris was, it

      have been buried at Byblus;<a href="#linknote-11105"       name="linknoteref-11105" id="linknoteref-11105">11105</a> which was near
      the mouth of the Adonis river. His worship was not perhaps very widely
      spread; but there are traces of it at Byblus, in Cyprus, and in Malta.<a

      at Carthage.<a href="#linknote-11108" name="linknoteref-11108"       id="linknoteref-11108">11108</a> He was represented with his head

      The Phoenicians worshipped their gods, like most other ancient nations,
      with prayer, with hymns of praise, with sacrifices, with processions, and
      with votive offerings. We do not know whether they had any regularly
      recurrent day, like the Jewish Sabbath, or Christian Sunday, on which
      worship took place in the temples generally; but at any rate each temple
      had its festival times, when multitudes flocked to it, and its gods were
      honoured with prolonged services and sacrifices on a larger scale than
      ordinary. Most festivals were annual, but some recurred at shorter
      intervals; and, besides the festivals, there was an every day cult, which
      was a duty incumbent upon the priests, but at which the private worshipper
      also might assist to offer prayer or sacrifice. The ordinary sacrificial
      animals were oxen, cows, goats, sheep, and lambs; swine were not offered,
      being regarded as unclean;<a href="#linknote-11112"       name="linknoteref-11112" id="linknoteref-11112">11112</a> but the stag was
      an acceptable victim, at any rate on certain occasions.<a
      href="#linknote-11113" name="linknoteref-11113" id="linknoteref-11113">11113</a>
      At all functions the priests attended in large numbers, habited in white
      garments of linen or cotton, and wearing a stiff cap or mitre upon their
      heads:<a href="#linknote-11114" name="linknoteref-11114"       id="linknoteref-11114">11114</a> on one occasion of a sacrifice Lucian
      counted above three hundred engaged in the ceremony.<a
      href="#linknote-11115" name="linknoteref-11115" id="linknoteref-11115">11115</a>
      It was the duty of some to slay the victims; of others to pour libations;
      of a third class to bear about pans of coal on which incense could be
      offered; of a fourth to attend upon the altars.<a href="#linknote-11116"       name="linknoteref-11116" id="linknoteref-11116">11116</a> The priests of
      each temple had at their head a Chief or High Priest, who was robed in
      purple and wore a golden tiara. His office, however, continued only for a
      year, when another was chosen to succeed him.<a href="#linknote-11117"       name="linknoteref-11117" id="linknoteref-11117">11117</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ordinarily, sacrifices were offered, in Phoenicia as elsewhere, singly,
      and upon altars; but sometimes it was customary to have a great holocaust.
      Large trees were dug up by the roots, and planted in the court of the
      temple; the victims, whether goats, or sheep, or cattle of any other kind,
      were suspended by ropes from the branches; birds were similarly attached,
      and garments, and vessels in gold and silver. Then the images of the gods
      belonging to the temple were brought out, and carried in a solemn
      procession round the trees; after which the trees were set on fire, and
      the whole was consumed in a mighty conflagration.<a href="#linknote-11118"       name="linknoteref-11118" id="linknoteref-11118">11118</a> The season for
      this great holocaust was the commencement of the spring-time, when the
      goodness of Heaven in once more causing life to spring up on every side
      seemed to require man&rsquo;s special acknowledgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hymns of praise are spoken of especially in connection with this same
      Spring-Festival.<a href="#linknote-11119" name="linknoteref-11119"       id="linknoteref-11119">11119</a> Votive offerings were continually being
      offered in every temple by such as believed that they had received any
      benefit from any god, either in consequence of their vows, or prayers, or
      even by the god&rsquo;s spontaneous action. The sites of temples yield numerous
      traces of such offerings. Sometimes they are in the shape of stone <i>stelæ</i>
      or pillars, inscribed and more or less ornamented,<a href="#linknote-11120"       name="linknoteref-11120" id="linknoteref-11120">11120</a> sometimes of
      tablets placed within an ornamental border, and generally accompanied by
      some rude sculptures;<a href="#linknote-11121" name="linknoteref-11121"       id="linknoteref-11121">11121</a> more often of figures, either in bronze
      or clay, which are mostly of a somewhat rude character. M. Renan observes
      with respect to these figures, which are extremely numerous:&mdash;&ldquo;Ought
      we to see in these images, as has been supposed, long series of portraits
      of priests and priestesses continued through several centuries? We do not
      think so. The person represented in these statues appears to us to be the
      author of a vow or of a sacrifice made to the divinity of the temple . . .
      Vows and sacrifices were very fleeting things; it might be feared that the
      divinity would soon forget them. An inscription was already recognised as
      a means of rendering the memory of a vow more lasting; but a statue was a
      momento still more&mdash;nay, much more efficacious. By having himself
      represented under the eyes of the divinity in the very act of
      accomplishing his vow, a man called to mind, as one may say, incessantly
      the offering which he had made to the god, and the homage which he had
      rendered him. An idea of this sort is altogether in conformity with the
      materialistic and self-interested character of the Phoenician worship,
      where the vow is a kind of business affair, a matter of debtor and
      creditor account, in which a man stipulates very clearly what he is to
      give, and holds firmly that he is to be paid in return . . . We have then,
      in these statues, representations of pious men, who came one after another
      to acquit themselves of their debt in the presence of the divinity; in
      order that the latter should not forget that the debt was discharged, they
      set up their images in front of the god. The image was larger or smaller,
      more or less carefully elaborated, in a more or less valuable material,
      according to the means of the individual who consecrated it."<a
      href="#linknote-11122" name="linknoteref-11122" id="linknoteref-11122">11122</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far there was no very remarkable difference between the Phoenician
      religious system and other ancient Oriental worships, which have a general
      family likeness, and differ chiefly in the names and number of the
      deities, the simplicity or complication of the rites, and the greater or
      less power and dignity attached to the priestly office. In these several
      respects the Phoenician religion seems to have leant towards the side of
      simplicity, the divinities recognised being, comparatively speaking, few,
      priestly influence not great, and the ceremonial not very elaborate. But
      there were two respects in which the religion was, if not singular, at any
      rate markedly different from ordinary polytheisms, though less in the
      principles involved than in the extent to which they were carried out in
      practice. These were the prevalence of licentious orgies and of human
      sacrifice. The worship of Astarte was characterised by the one, the
      worship of Baal by the other. Phoenician mythology taught that the great
      god, Il or El, when reigning upon earth as king of Byblus, had, under
      circumstances of extreme danger to his native land, sacrificed his dearly
      loved son, Ieoud, as an expiatory offering. Divine sanction had thus been
      given to the horrid rite; and thenceforth, whenever in Phoenicia either
      public or private calamity threatened, it became customary that human
      victims should be selected, the nobler and more honourable the better, and
      that the wrath of the gods should be appeased by taking their lives. The
      mode of death was horrible. The sacrifices were to be consumed by fire;
      the life given by the Fire God he should also take back again by the
      flames which destroy being. The rabbis describe the image of Moloch as a
      human figure with a bull&rsquo;s head and outstretched arms;<a
      href="#linknote-11123" name="linknoteref-11123" id="linknoteref-11123">11123</a>
      and the account which they give is confirmed by what Diodorus relates of
      the Carthaginian Kronos. His image, Diodorus says,<a href="#linknote-11124"       name="linknoteref-11124" id="linknoteref-11124">11124</a> was of metal,
      and was made hot by a fire kindled within it; the victims were placed in
      its arms and thence rolled into the fiery lap below. The most usual form
      of the rite was the sacrifice of their children&mdash;especially of their
      eldest sons<a href="#linknote-11125" name="linknoteref-11125"       id="linknoteref-11125">11125</a>&mdash;by parents. &ldquo;This custom was
      grounded in part on the notion that children were the dearest possession
      of their parents, and, in part, that as pure and innocent beings they were
      the offerings of atonement most certain to pacify the anger of the deity;
      and further, that the god of whose essence the generative power of nature
      was had a just title of that which was begotten of man, and to the
      surrender of their children&rsquo;s lives . . . Voluntary offering on the part
      of the parents was essential to the success of the sacrifice; even the
      first-born, nay, the only child of the family, was given up. The parents
      stopped the cries of their children by fondling and kissing them, for the
      victim ought not to weep; and the sound of complaint was drowned in the
      din of flutes and kettledrums. Mothers, according to Plutarch,<a
      href="#linknote-11126" name="linknoteref-11126" id="linknoteref-11126">11126</a>
      stood by without tears or sobs; if they wept or sobbed they lost the
      honour of the act, and their children were sacrificed notwithstanding.
      Such sacrifices took place either annually or on an appointed day, or
      before great enterprises, or on the occasion of public calamities, to
      appease the wrath of the god."<a href="#linknote-11127"       name="linknoteref-11127" id="linknoteref-11127">11127</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the worship of Astarte the prostitution of women, and of effeminate
      men, played the same part that child murder did in the worship of Baal.
      &ldquo;This practice,&rdquo; says Dr. Döllinger,<a href="#linknote-11128"       name="linknoteref-11128" id="linknoteref-11128">11128</a> &ldquo;so widely
      spread in the world of old, the delusion that no service more acceptable
      could be rendered a deity than that of unchastity, was deeply rooted in
      the Asiatic mind. Where the deity was in idea sexual, or where two deities
      in chief, one a male and the other a female, stood in juxtaposition, there
      the sexual relation appeared as founded upon the essence of the deity
      itself, and the instinct and its satisfaction as that in men which most
      corresponded with the deity. Thus lust itself became a service of the
      gods; and, as the fundamental idea of sacrifice is that of the immediate
      or substitutive surrender of a man&rsquo;s self to the deity, so the woman could
      do the goddess no better service than by prostitution. Hence it was the
      custom [in some places] that a maiden before her marriage should
      prostitute herself once in the temple of the goddess;<a
      href="#linknote-11129" name="linknoteref-11129" id="linknoteref-11129">11129</a>
      and this was regarded as the same in kind with the offering of the
      first-fruits of the field.&rdquo; Lucian, a heathen and an eye-witness, tells us<a
      href="#linknote-11130" name="linknoteref-11130" id="linknoteref-11130">11130</a>&mdash;&ldquo;I
      saw at Byblus the grand temple of the Byblian Venus, in which are
      accomplished the orgies relating to Adonis; and I learnt the nature of the
      orgies. For the Byblians say that the wounding of Adonis by the boar took
      place in their country; and, in memory of the accident, they year by year
      beat their breasts, and utter lamentations, and go through the orgies, and
      hold a great mourning throughout the land. When the weeping is ended,
      first of all, they make to Adonis the offerings usually made to a corpse;
      after which, on the next day, they feign that he has come to life again,
      and hold a procession [of his image] in the open air. But previously they
      shave their heads, like the Egyptians when an Apis dies; and if any woman
      refuse to do so, she must sell her beauty during one day to all who like.
      Only strangers, however, are permitted to make the purchase, and the money
      paid is expended on a sacrifice which is offered to the goddess.&rdquo; &ldquo;In this
      way,&rdquo; as Dr. Döllinger goes on to say, &ldquo;they went so far at last as to
      contemplate the abominations of unnatural lust as a homage rendered to the
      deity, and to exalt it into a regular cultus. The worship of the goddess
      [Ashtoreth] at Aphaca in the Lebanon was specially notorious in this
      respect."<a href="#linknote-11131" name="linknoteref-11131"       id="linknoteref-11131">11131</a> Here, according to Eusebius, was, so late
      as the time of Constantine the Great, a temple in which the old Phoenician
      rites were still retained. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;was a grove and a sacred
      enclosure, not situated, as most temples are, in the midst of a city, and
      of market-places, and of broad streets, but far away from either road or
      path, on the rocky slopes of Libanus. It was dedicated to a shameful
      goddess, the goddess Aphrodite. A school of wickedness was this place for
      all such profligate persons as had ruined their bodies by excessive
      luxury. The men there were soft and womanish&mdash;men no longer; the
      dignity of their sex they rejected; with impure lust they thought to
      honour the deity. Criminal intercourse with women, secret pollutions,
      disgraceful and nameless deeds, were practised in the temple, where there
      was no restraining law, and no guardian to preserve decency."<a
      href="#linknote-11132" name="linknoteref-11132" id="linknoteref-11132">11132</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      One fruit of this system was the extraordinary institution of the Galli.
      The Galli were men, who made themselves as much like women as they could,
      and offered themselves for purposes of unnatural lust to either sex. Their
      existence may be traced in Israel and Judah,<a href="#linknote-11133"       name="linknoteref-11133" id="linknoteref-11133">11133</a> as well as in
      Syria and Phoenicia.<a href="#linknote-11134" name="linknoteref-11134"       id="linknoteref-11134">11134</a> At great festivals, under the influence
      of a strong excitement, amid the din of flutes and drums and wild songs, a
      number of the male devotees would snatch up swords or knives, which lay
      ready for the purpose, throw off their garments, and coming forward with a
      loud shout, proceed to castrate themselves openly. They would then run
      through the streets of the city, with the mutilated parts in their hands,
      and throw them into the houses of the inhabitants, who were bound in such
      case to provide the thrower with all the apparel and other gear needful
      for a woman.<a href="#linknote-11135" name="linknoteref-11135"       id="linknoteref-11135">11135</a> This apparel they thenceforth wore, and
      were recognised as attached to the worship of Astarte, entitled to reside
      in her temples, and authorised to take part in her ceremonies. They joined
      with the priests and the sacred women at festival times in frenzied dances
      and other wild orgies, shouting, and cutting themselves on the arms, and
      submitting to be flogged one by another.<a href="#linknote-11136"       name="linknoteref-11136" id="linknoteref-11136">11136</a> At other seasons
      they &ldquo;wandered from place to place, taking with them a veiled image or
      symbol of their goddess, and clad in women&rsquo;s apparel of many colours, and
      with their faces and eyes painted in female fashion, armed with swords and
      scourges, they threw themselves by a wild dance into bacchanalian ecstasy,
      in which their long hair was draggled through the mud. They bit their own
      arms, and then hacked themselves with their swords, or scourged themselves
      in penance for a sin supposed to have been committed against the goddess.
      In these scenes, got up to aid the collection of money, by long practice
      they contrived to cut themselves so adroitly as not to inflict on
      themselves any very serious wounds."<a href="#linknote-11137"       name="linknoteref-11137" id="linknoteref-11137">11137</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is difficult to estimate the corrupting effect upon practice and morals
      of a religious system which embraced within it so many sensual and
      degrading elements. Where impurity is made an essential part of religion,
      there the very fountain of life is poisoned, and that which should have
      been &ldquo;a savour of life unto life&rdquo;&mdash;a cleansing and regenerating
      influence&mdash;becomes &ldquo;a savour of death unto death&rdquo;&mdash;an influence
      leading on to the worst forms of moral degradation. Phoenician religion
      worked itself out, and showed its true character, in the first three
      centuries after our era, at Aphaca, at Hierapolis, and at Antioch, where,
      in the time of Julian, even a Libanius confessed that the great festival
      of the year consisted only in the perpetration of all that was impure and
      shameless, and the renunciation of every lingering spark of decency.<a

    <p>
      A vivid conception of another world, and of the reality of a life after
      death, especially if connected with a belief in future rewards and
      punishments, might have done much, or at any rate something, to counteract
      the effect upon morals and conduct of the degrading tenets and practices
      connected with the Astarte worship; but, so far as appears, the
      Phoenicians had a very faint and dim conception of the life to come, and
      neither hoped for happiness, nor feared misery in it. Their care for the
      preservation of their bodies after death, and the provision which in some
      cases they are seen to have made for them,<a href="#linknote-11139"       name="linknoteref-11139" id="linknoteref-11139">11139</a> imply a belief
      that death was not the end of everything, and a few vague expressions in
      inscriptions upon tombs point to a similar conviction;<a
      href="#linknote-11140" name="linknoteref-11140" id="linknoteref-11140">11140</a>
      but the life of the other world seems to have been regarded as something
      imperfect and precarious<a href="#linknote-11141" name="linknoteref-11141"       id="linknoteref-11141">11141</a>&mdash;a sort of shadowy existence in a
      gloomy <i>Sheôl</i>, where was neither pleasure nor pain, neither
      suffering nor enjoyment, but only quietness and rest. The thought of it
      did not occupy men&rsquo;s minds, or exercise any perceptible influence over
      their conduct. It was a last home, whereto all must go, acquiesced in, but
      neither hoped for nor dreaded. A Phoenician&rsquo;s feelings on the subject were
      probably very much those expressed by Job in his lament:&mdash;<a

     &ldquo;Why died I not from the womb? Why gave I not up the ghost at my

     For now should I have lain still and been quiet;

      Still their religion, such as it was, had a great hold upon the
      Phoenicians. Parents gave to their children, almost always, religious
      names, recognising each son and daughter as a gift from heaven, or placing
      them under the special protection of the gods generally, or of some single
      divinity. It was piety, an earnest but mistaken piety, which so often
      caused the parent to sacrifice his child&mdash;the very apple of his eye
      and delight of his heart&mdash;that so he might make satisfaction for the
      sins which he felt in his inmost soul that he had committed. It was piety
      that filled the temples with such throngs, that brought for sacrifice so
      many victims, that made the worshipper in every difficulty put up a vow to
      heaven, and caused the payment of the vows in such extraordinary
      profusion. At Carthage alone there have been found many hundreds of
      stones, each one of which records the payment of a vow;<a
      href="#linknote-11143" name="linknoteref-11143" id="linknoteref-11143">11143</a>
      while other sites have furnished hundreds or even thousands of <i>ex votos</i>&mdash;statues,
      busts, statuettes, figures of animals, cylinders, seals, rings, bracelets,
      anklets, ear-rings, necklaces, ornaments for the hair, vases, amphoræ,
      oenochoæ, pateræ, jugs, cups, goblets, bowls, dishes, models of boats and
      chariots&mdash;indicative of an almost unexampled devotion. A single
      chamber in the treasury of Curium produced more than three hundred
      articles in silver and silver-gilt;<a href="#linknote-11144"       name="linknoteref-11144" id="linknoteref-11144">11144</a> the temple of
      Golgi yielded 228 votive statues;<a href="#linknote-11145"       name="linknoteref-11145" id="linknoteref-11145">11145</a> sites in
      Sardinia scarcely mentioned in antiquity have sufficed to fill whole
      museums with statuettes, rings, and scarabs. If the Phoenicians did not
      give evidence of the depth of their religious feeling by erecting, like
      most nations, temples of vast size and magnificence, still they left in
      numerous places unmistakable proof of the reality of their devotion to the
      unseen powers by the multiplicity, and in many cases the splendour,<a
      href="#linknote-11146" name="linknoteref-11146" id="linknoteref-11146">11146</a>
      of their votive offerings.

    <p>
      The dress of the Phoenician men, especially of those belonging to the
      lower orders, consisted, for the most part, of a single close-fitting
      tunic, which reached from the waist to a little above the knee.<a
      href="#linknote-0121" name="linknoteref-0121" id="linknoteref-0121">0121</a>
      The material was probably either linen or cotton, and the simple garment
      was perfectly plain and unornamented, like the common <i>shenti</i> of the
      Egyptians. On the head was generally worn a cap of one kind or another,
      sometimes round, more often conical, occasionally shaped like a helmet.
      The conical head-dresses seem to have often ended in a sort of top-knot or
      button, which recalls the head-dress of a Chinese Mandarin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where the men were of higher rank, the <i>shenti</i> was ornamented. It
      was patterned, and parted towards the two sides, while a richly adorned
      lappet, terminating in uræi, fell down in front.<a href="#linknote-0122"       name="linknoteref-0122" id="linknoteref-0122">0122</a> The girdle, from
      which it depended, was also patterned, and the <i>shenti</i> thus arranged
      was sometimes a not inelegant garment. In addition to the <i>shenti</i>,
      it was common among the upper classes to wear over the bust and shoulders
      a close-fitting tunic with short sleeves,<a href="#linknote-0123"       name="linknoteref-0123" id="linknoteref-0123">0123</a> like a modern
      &ldquo;jersey;&rdquo; and sometimes two garments were worn, an inner robe descending
      to the feet, and an outer blouse or shirt, with sleeves reaching to the
      elbow.<a href="#linknote-0124" name="linknoteref-0124"       id="linknoteref-0124">0124</a> Occasionally, instead of this outer blouse,
      the man of rank has a mantle thrown over the left shoulder, which falls
      about him in folds that are sufficiently graceful.<a href="#linknote-0125"       name="linknoteref-0125" id="linknoteref-0125">0125</a> The conical cap
      with a top-knot is, with persons of this class, the almost universal
      head-dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great attention seems to have been paid to the hair and beard. Where no
      cap is worn, the hair clings closely to the head in a wavy compact mass,
      escaping however from below the wreath or diadem, which supplies the place
      of a cap, in one or two rows of crisp, rounded curls.<a
      href="#linknote-0126" name="linknoteref-0126" id="linknoteref-0126">0126</a>
      The beard has mostly a strong resemblance to that affected by the
      Assyrians, and familiar to us from their sculptures. It is arranged in
      three, four, or five rows of small tight curls,<a href="#linknote-0127"       name="linknoteref-0127" id="linknoteref-0127">0127</a> and extends from
      ear to ear around the cheeks and chin. Sometimes, however, in lieu of the
      many rows, we find one row only, the beard falling in tresses, which are
      curled at the extremity.<a href="#linknote-0128" name="linknoteref-0128"       id="linknoteref-0128">0128</a> There is no indication of the Phoenicians
      having cultivated mustachios.
    </p>
    <p>
      For ornaments the male Phoenicians wore collars, which were sometimes very
      elaborate, armlets, bracelets, and probably finger-rings. The collars
      resembled those of the Egyptians, being arranged in three rows, and
      falling far over the breast.<a href="#linknote-0129"       name="linknoteref-0129" id="linknoteref-0129">0129</a> The armlets seem to
      have been plain, consisting of a mere twist of metal, once, twice, or
      thrice around the limb.<a href="#linknote-1210" name="linknoteref-1210"       id="linknoteref-1210">1210</a> The royal armlets of Etyander, king of
      Paphos, are single twists of gold, the ends of which only just overlap:
      they are plain, except for the inscription, which reads <i>Eteadoro to
      Papo basileos</i>, or &ldquo;The property of Etyander, king of Paphos."<a
      href="#linknote-1211" name="linknoteref-1211" id="linknoteref-1211">1211</a>
      Men&rsquo;s bracelets were similar in character. The finger-rings were either of
      gold or silver, and generally set with a stone, which bore a device, and
      which the wearer used as a seal.<a href="#linknote-1212"       name="linknoteref-1212" id="linknoteref-1212">1212</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The most elaborate male costume which has come down to us is that of a
      figure found at Golgi, and believed to represent a high priest of
      Ashtoreth. The conical head-dress is divided into partitions by narrow
      stripes, which, beginning at its lower edge, converge to a point at top.
      This point is crowned by the representation of a calf&rsquo;s or bull&rsquo;s head.
      The main garment is a long robe reaching from the neck to the feet, &ldquo;worn
      in much the same manner as the peplos on early Greek female figures.&rdquo;
       Round the neck of the robe are two rows of stars painted in red, probably
      meant to represent embroidery. A little below the knee is another band of
      embroidery, from which the robe falls in folds or pleats, which gather
      closely around the legs. Above the long robe is worn a mantle, which
      covers the right arm and shoulder, and thence hangs down below the right
      knee, passing also in many folds from the shoulder across the breast, and
      thence, after a twist around the left arm, falling down below the left
      knee. The treatment of the hair is remarkable. Below the rim of the cap is
      the usual row of crisp curls; but besides these, there depend from behind
      the ears on either side of the neck three long tresses. The feet of the
      figure are naked. The right hand holds a cup by its foot between the
      middle and fore-fingers, while the left holds a dove with wings outspread.<a
      href="#linknote-1213" name="linknoteref-1213" id="linknoteref-1213">1213</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Women were, for the most part, draped very carefully from head to foot.
      The nude figures which are found abundantly in the Phoenician remains<a
      href="#linknote-1214" name="linknoteref-1214" id="linknoteref-1214">1214</a>
      are figures of goddesses, especially of Astarte, who were considered not
      to need the ornament, or the concealment of dress. Human female figures
      are in almost every case covered from the neck to the feet, generally in
      garments with many folds, which, however, are arranged very variously.
      Sometimes a single robe of the amplest dimensions seems to envelop the
      whole form, which it completely conceals with heavy folds of drapery.<a
      href="#linknote-1215" name="linknoteref-1215" id="linknoteref-1215">1215</a>
      The long petticoat is sleeved, and gathered into a sinus below the
      breasts, about which it hangs loosely. Sometimes, on the contrary, the
      petticoat is perfectly plain, and has no folds.<a href="#linknote-1216"       name="linknoteref-1216" id="linknoteref-1216">1216</a> Occasionally a
      second garment is worn over the gown or robe, which covers the left
      shoulder and the lap, descending to the knees, or somewhat lower.<a
      href="#linknote-1217" name="linknoteref-1217" id="linknoteref-1217">1217</a>
      The waist is generally confined by a girdle, which is knotted in front.<a
      href="#linknote-1218" name="linknoteref-1218" id="linknoteref-1218">1218</a>
      There are a few instances in which the feet are enclosed in sandals.<a
      href="#linknote-1219" name="linknoteref-1219" id="linknoteref-1219">1219</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The hair of women is sometimes concealed under a cap, but generally it
      escapes from such confinement, and shows itself below the cap in great
      rolls, or in wavy masses, which flow off right and left from a parting
      over the middle of the forehead.<a href="#linknote-1220"       name="linknoteref-1220" id="linknoteref-1220">1220</a> Tresses are worn
      occasionally: these depend behind either ear in long loose curls, which
      fall upon the shoulders.<a href="#linknote-1221" name="linknoteref-1221"       id="linknoteref-1221">1221</a> Female heads are mostly covered with a
      loose hood, or cap; but sometimes the hair is merely encircled by a band
      or bands, above and below which it ripples freely.<a href="#linknote-1222"       name="linknoteref-1222" id="linknoteref-1222">1222</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Phoenician women were greatly devoted to the use of personal ornaments. It
      was probably from them that the Hebrew women of Isaiah&rsquo;s time derived the
      &ldquo;tinkling ornaments of the feet, the cauls, the round tires like the moon,
      the chains, the bracelets, and the mufflers, the bonnets and the ornaments
      of the legs, and the head-bands, and the tablets, and the ear-rings, the
      rings and nose-jewels, the changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles,
      and the wimples, and the crisping pins, the glasses, and the fine linen,
      and the hoods, and the vails,"<a href="#linknote-1223"       name="linknoteref-1223" id="linknoteref-1223">1223</a> which the prophet
      denounces so fiercely. The excavations made on Phoenician sites have
      yielded in abundance necklaces, armlets, bracelets, pendants to be worn as
      lockets, ear-rings, finger-rings, ornaments for the hair, buckles or
      brooches, seals, buttons, and various articles of the toilet such as women
      delight in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Women wore, it appears, three or four necklaces at the same time, one
      above the other.<a href="#linknote-1224" name="linknoteref-1224"       id="linknoteref-1224">1224</a> A string of small beads or pearls would
      closely encircle the neck just under the chin. Below, where the chest
      begins, would lie a second string of larger beads, perhaps of gold,
      perhaps only of glass, while further down, as the chest expands, would be
      rows of still larger ornaments, pendants in glass, or crystal, or gold, or
      agate modelled into the shape of acorns, or pomegranates, or lotus
      flowers, or cones, or vases, and lying side by side to the number of fifty
      or sixty. Several of the necklaces worn by the Cypriote ladies have come
      down to us. One is composed of a row of one hundred and three gold beads,
      alternately round and oval, to the oval ones of which are attached
      pendants, also in gold, representing alternately the blossom and bud of
      the lotus plant, except in one instance. The central bead of all has as
      its pendant a human head and bust, modelled in the Egyptian style, with
      the hair falling in lappets on either side of the face, and with a broad
      collar upon the shoulders and the breast.<a href="#linknote-1225"       name="linknoteref-1225" id="linknoteref-1225">1225</a> Another consists of
      sixty-four gold beads, twenty-two of which are of superior size to the
      rest, and of eighteen pendants, shaped like the bud of a flower, and
      delicately chased.<a href="#linknote-1226" name="linknoteref-1226"       id="linknoteref-1226">1226</a> There are others where gold beads are
      intermixed with small carnelian and onyx bugles, while the pendants are of
      gold, like the beads; or where gold and rock-crystal beads alternate, and
      a single crystal vase hangs as pendant in the middle; or where alternate
      carnelian and gold beads have as pendant a carnelian cone, a symbol of
      Astarte.<a href="#linknote-1227" name="linknoteref-1227"       id="linknoteref-1227">1227</a> Occasionally the sole material used is
      glass. Necklaces have been found composed entirely of long oval beads of
      blue or greenish-blue glass; others where the colour of the beads is a
      dark olive;<a href="#linknote-1228" name="linknoteref-1228"       id="linknoteref-1228">1228</a> others again, where all the component parts
      are of glass, but the colours and forms are greatly varied. In a glass
      necklace found at Tharros in Sardinia, besides beads of various sizes and
      hues, there are two long rough cylinders, four heads of animals, and a
      human head as central ornament. &ldquo;Taken separately, the various elements of
      which this necklace is composed have little value; neither the heads of
      the animals, nor the bearded human face, perhaps representing Bacchus, are
      in good style; the cylinders and rounded beads which fill up the
      intermediate spaces between the principal objects are of very poor
      execution; but the mixture of whites, and greys, and yellows, and greens,
      and blues produces a whole which is harmonious and gay."<a
      href="#linknote-1229" name="linknoteref-1229" id="linknoteref-1229">1229</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the most elegant and tasteful necklace of all that have been
      discovered is the one made of a thick solid gold cord, very soft and
      elastic, which is figured on the page opposite.<a href="#linknote-1230"       name="linknoteref-1230" id="linknoteref-1230">1230</a> At either extremity
      is a cylinder of very fine granulated work, terminating in one case in a
      lion&rsquo;s head of good execution, in the other surmounted by a simple cap.
      The lion&rsquo;s mouth holds a ring, while the cap supports a long hook, which
      seems to issue from a somewhat complicated knot, entangled wherein is a
      single light rosette. &ldquo;In this arrangement, in the curves of the thin
      wire, which folds back upon itself again and again, there is an air of
      ease, an apparent negligence, which is the very perfection of technical
      skill."<a href="#linknote-1231" name="linknoteref-1231"       id="linknoteref-1231">1231</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The bracelets worn by the Phoenician ladies were of many kinds, and
      frequently of great beauty. Some were bands of plain solid gold, without
      ornament of any kind, very heavy, weighing from 200 to 300 grammes each.<a
      href="#linknote-1232" name="linknoteref-1232" id="linknoteref-1232">1232</a>
      Others were open, and terminated at either extremity in the head of an
      animal. One, found by General Di Cesnola at Curium in Cyprus,<a
      href="#linknote-1233" name="linknoteref-1233" id="linknoteref-1233">1233</a>
      exhibited at the two ends heads of lions, which seemed to threaten each
      other. The execution of the heads left nothing to be desired. Some others,
      found in Phoenicia Proper, in a state of extraordinary preservation, were
      of similar design, but, in the place of lions&rsquo; heads, exhibited the heads
      of bull, with very short horns.<a href="#linknote-1234"       name="linknoteref-1234" id="linknoteref-1234">1234</a> A third type aimed
      at greater variety, and showed the head of a wild goat at one end, and
      that of a ram at the other.<a href="#linknote-1235" name="linknoteref-1235"       id="linknoteref-1235">1235</a> In a few instances, the animal
      representation appears at one extremity of the bracelet only, as in a
      specimen from Camirus, whereof the workmanship is unmistakably Phoenician,
      which has a lion&rsquo;s head at one end, and at the other tapers off, like the
      tail of a serpent.<a href="#linknote-1236" name="linknoteref-1236"       id="linknoteref-1236">1236</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      A pair of bracelets in the British Museum, said to have come from Tharros,
      consist of plain thin circlets of gold, with a ball of gold in the middle.
      The ball is ornamented with spirals and projecting knobs, which must have
      been uncomfortable to the wearer, but are said not to be wanting in
      elegance.<a href="#linknote-1237" name="linknoteref-1237"       id="linknoteref-1237">1237</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are other Phoenician bracelets of an entirely different character.
      These consist of broad flat bands, which fitted closely to the wrist, and
      were fastened round it by means of a clasp. Two, now in the Museum of New
      York, are bands of gold about an inch in width, ornamented externally with
      rosettes, flowers, and other designs in high relief, on which are visible
      in places the remains of a blue enamel.<a href="#linknote-1238"       name="linknoteref-1238" id="linknoteref-1238">1238</a> Another is composed
      of fifty-four large-ribbed gold beads, soldered together by threes, and
      having for centre a gold medallion, with a large onyx set in it, and with
      four gold pendants.<a href="#linknote-1239" name="linknoteref-1239"       id="linknoteref-1239">1239</a> A third bracelet of the kind, said to have
      been found at Tharros, consists of six plates, united by hinges, and very
      delicately engraved with patterns of a thoroughly Phoenician character,
      representing palms, volutes, and flowers.<a href="#linknote-1240"       name="linknoteref-1240" id="linknoteref-1240">1240</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is in their earrings that the Phoenician ladies were most curious
      and most fanciful. They present to us, as MM. Perrot and Chipiez note, &ldquo;an
      astonishing variety."<a href="#linknote-1241" name="linknoteref-1241"       id="linknoteref-1241">1241</a> Some, which must have been very expensive,
      are composed of many distinct parts, connected with each other by chains
      of an elegant pattern. One of the most beautiful specimens was found by
      General Di Cesnola in Cyprus.<a href="#linknote-1242"       name="linknoteref-1242" id="linknoteref-1242">1242</a> There is a hook at
      top, by which it was suspended. Then follows a medallion, where the
      workmanship is of singular delicacy. A rosette occupies the centre; around
      it are a set of spirals, negligently arranged, and enclosed within a
      chain-like band, outside of which is a double beading. From the medallion
      depend by finely wrought chains five objects. The central chain supports a
      human head, to which is attached a conical vase, covered at top: on either
      side are two short chains, terminating in rings, from which hang small
      nondescript pendants: beyond are two longer chains, with small vases or
      bottles attached. Another, found in Sardinia, is scarcely less
      complicated. The ring which pierced the ear forms the handle of a kind of
      basket, which is covered with lines of bead-work: below, attached by means
      of two rings, is the model of a hawk with wings folded; below the hawk,
      again attached by a couple of rings, is a vase of elegant shape, decorated
      with small bosses, lozenges, and chevrons.<a href="#linknote-1243"       name="linknoteref-1243" id="linknoteref-1243">1243</a> Other ear-rings
      have been found similar in type to this, but simplified by the omission of
      the bird, or of the basket.<a href="#linknote-1244" name="linknoteref-1244"       id="linknoteref-1244">1244</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      An entirely different type is that furnished by an ear-ring in the Museum
      of New York brought from Cyprus, where the loop of the ornament rises from
      a sort of horse-shoe, patterned with bosses and spirals, and surrounded by
      a rough edging of knobs, standing at a little distance one from another.<a
      href="#linknote-1245" name="linknoteref-1245" id="linknoteref-1245">1245</a>
      Other forms found also in Cyprus are the ear-ring with the long pendant,
      which has been called &ldquo;an elongated pear,"<a href="#linknote-1246"       name="linknoteref-1246" id="linknoteref-1246">1246</a> ornamented towards
      the lower end with small blossoms of flowers, and terminating in a minute
      ball, which recalls the &ldquo;drops&rdquo; that are still used by the jewellers of
      our day; the loop which supports a <i>crux ansata</i>;<a

      that which has attached to it a small square box, or measure containing a
      heap of grain, thought to represent wheat;<a href="#linknote-1248"       name="linknoteref-1248" id="linknoteref-1248">1248</a> and those which
      support fruit of various kinds.<a href="#linknote-1249"       name="linknoteref-1249" id="linknoteref-1249">1249</a> An ear-ring of much
      delicacy consists of a twisted ring, curved into a hook at one extremity,
      and at the other ending in the head of a goat, with a ring attached to it,
      through which the hook passes.<a href="#linknote-1250"       name="linknoteref-1250" id="linknoteref-1250">1250</a> Another, rather
      curious than elegant, consists of a double twist, ornamented with
      lozenges, and terminating in triangular points finely granulated.<a
      href="#linknote-1251" name="linknoteref-1251" id="linknoteref-1251">1251</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ornaments more or less resembling this last type of ear-ring, but larger
      and coarser, have given rise to some controversy, having been regarded by
      some as ear-rings, by others as fastenings for the dress, and by a third
      set of critics as ornaments for the hair. They consist of a double twist,
      sometimes ornamented at one end only, sometimes at both. A lion&rsquo;s or a
      griffin&rsquo;s head crowns usually the principal end; round the neck is a
      double or triple collar, and below this a rosette, very carefully
      elaborated. In one instance two griffins show themselves side by side,
      exhibiting their heads, their chests, their wings, and their fore-paws or
      hands; between them is an ornament like that which commonly surmounts
      Phoenician <i>stelæ</i>; and below this a most beautiful rosette.<a
      href="#linknote-1252" name="linknoteref-1252" id="linknoteref-1252">1252</a>
      The fashioning shows that the back of the ornament was not intended to be
      seen, and favours the view that it was to be placed where a mass of hair
      would afford the necessary concealment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Phoenician ladies seem also to have understood the use of hair-pins,
      which were from two to three inches long, and had large heads, ribbed
      longitudinally, and crowned with two smaller balls, one above the other.<a
      href="#linknote-1253" name="linknoteref-1253" id="linknoteref-1253">1253</a>
      The material used was either gold or silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      To fasten their dresses, the Phoenician ladies used <i>fibulæ</i> or
      buckles of a simple character. Brooches set with stones have not at
      present been found on Phoenician sites; but in certain cases the fibulæ
      show a moderate amount of ornament. Some have glass beads strung on the
      pin that is inserted into the catch; others have the rounded portion
      surmounted by the figure of a horse or of a bird.<a href="#linknote-1254"       name="linknoteref-1254" id="linknoteref-1254">1254</a> Most fibulæ are in
      bronze; but one, found in the treasury of Curium, and now in the Museum of
      New York, was of gold.<a href="#linknote-1255" name="linknoteref-1255"       id="linknoteref-1255">1255</a> This, however, was most probably a votive
      offering.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible at present to reproduce the toilet table of a Phoenician
      lady. We may be tolerably sure, however, that certain indispensable
      articles would not be lacking. Circular mirrors, either of polished metal,
      or of glass backed by a plate of tin or silver, would undoubtedly have
      found their place on them, together with various vessels for holding
      perfumes and ointments. A vase in rock crystal, discovered at Curium, with
      a funnel and cover in gold, the latter attached by a fine gold chain to
      one of its handles,<a href="#linknote-1256" name="linknoteref-1256"       id="linknoteref-1256">1256</a> was doubtless a fine lady&rsquo;s favourite
      smelling bottle. Various other vessels in silver, of a small size,<a
      href="#linknote-1257" name="linknoteref-1257" id="linknoteref-1257">1257</a>
      as basins and bowls beautifully chased, tiny jugs, alabasti, ladles, &amp;c.,
      had also the appearance of belonging rather to the toilet table than to
      the plate-basket. Some of the alabasti would contain <i>kohl</i> or <i>stibium</i>,
      some salves and ointments, others perhaps perfumed washes for the
      complexion. Among the bronze objects found,<a href="#linknote-1258"       name="linknoteref-1258" id="linknoteref-1258">1258</a> some may have been
      merely ornaments, others stands for rings, bracelets, and the like. One
      terra-cotta vase from Dali seems made for holding pigments,<a
      href="#linknote-1259" name="linknoteref-1259" id="linknoteref-1259">1259</a>
      and raises the suspicion that Phoenician, or at any rate Cyprian, beauties
      were not above heightening their charms by the application of paint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Women in Phoenicia seem to have enjoyed considerable freedom. They are
      represented as banqueting in the company of men, sometimes sitting with
      them on the same couch, sometimes reclining with them at the same table.<a
      href="#linknote-1260" name="linknoteref-1260" id="linknoteref-1260">1260</a>
      Occasionally they delight their male companion by playing upon the lyre or
      the double pipe,<a href="#linknote-1261" name="linknoteref-1261"       id="linknoteref-1261">1261</a> while in certain instances they are
      associated in bands of three, who perform on the lyre, the double pipe,
      and the tambourine.<a href="#linknote-1262" name="linknoteref-1262"       id="linknoteref-1262">1262</a> They take part in religious processions,
      and present offerings to the deities.<a href="#linknote-1263"       name="linknoteref-1263" id="linknoteref-1263">1263</a> The positions
      occupied in history by Jezebel and Dido fall in with these indications,
      and imply a greater approach to equality between the sexes in Phoenicia
      than in Oriental communities generally.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men were, for Orientals, unusually hardy and active. In only one
      instance is there any appearance of the use of the parasol by a
      Phoenician.<a href="#linknote-1264" name="linknoteref-1264"       id="linknoteref-1264">1264</a> Sandals are infrequently worn; neck, chest,
      arms, and legs are commonly naked. The rough life of seamen hardened the
      greater number; others hunted the wild ox and the wild boar<a
      href="#linknote-1265" name="linknoteref-1265" id="linknoteref-1265">1265</a>
      in the marshy plains of the coast tract, and in the umbrageous dells of
      Lebanon. Even the lion may have been affronted in the great mountain, and
      if we are unable to describe the method of its chase in Phoenicia, the
      reason is that the Phoenician artists have, in their representations of
      lion hunts, adopted almost exclusively Assyrian models.<a
      href="#linknote-1266" name="linknoteref-1266" id="linknoteref-1266">1266</a>
      The Phoenician gift of facile imitation was a questionable advantage,
      since it led the native artists continually to substitute for sketches at
      first hand of scenes with which they were familiar, conventional
      renderings of similar scenes as depicted by foreigners.
    </p>
    <p>
      An ornament found in Cyprus, the intention of which is uncertain, finds
      its proper place in the present chapter, though we cannot attach it to any
      particular class of objects. It consists of a massive knob of solid agate,
      with a cylinder of the same both above and below, through which a rod, or
      bar, must have been intended to pass. Some archæologists see in it the top
      of a sceptre;<a href="#linknote-1267" name="linknoteref-1267"       id="linknoteref-1267">1267</a> others, the head of a mace;<a
      href="#linknote-1268" name="linknoteref-1268" id="linknoteref-1268">1268</a>
      but there is nothing really to prove its use. We might imagine it the
      adornment of a throne or chair of state, or the end of a chariot pole, or
      a portion of the stem of a candelabrum. Antiquity has furnished nothing
      similar with which to compare it; and we only say of it, that, whatever
      was its purpose, so large and so beautiful a mass of agate has scarcely
      been met with elsewhere.<a href="#linknote-1269" name="linknoteref-1269"       id="linknoteref-1269">1269</a> The cutting is such as to show very
      exquisitely the veining of the material.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bronze objects in almost infinite variety have been found on Phoenician
      sites,<a href="#linknote-1270" name="linknoteref-1270"       id="linknoteref-1270">1270</a> but only a few of them can have been
      personal ornaments. They comprise lamps, bowls, vases, jugs, cups,
      armlets, anklets, daggers, dishes, a horse&rsquo;s bit, heads and feet of
      animals, statuettes, mirrors, fibulæ, buttons, &amp;c. Furniture would
      seem to have been largely composed of bronze, which sometimes formed its
      entire fabric, though generally confined to the ornamentation. Ivory was
      likewise employed in considerable quantities in the manufacture of
      furniture,<a href="#linknote-1271" name="linknoteref-1271"       id="linknoteref-1271">1271</a> to which it was applied as an outer
      covering, or veneer, either plain, or more generally carved with a pattern
      or with figures. The &ldquo;ivory house&rdquo; of Ahab<a href="#linknote-1272"       name="linknoteref-1272" id="linknoteref-1272">1272</a> was perhaps so
      called, not so much from the application of the precious material to the
      doors and walls, as from its employment in the furniture. There is every
      probability that it was the construction of Phoenician artists.

</pre>
    <p>
      The Phoenician alphabet, like the Hebrew, consisted of twenty-two
      characters, which had, it is probable, the same names with the Hebrew
      letters,<a href="#linknote-0131" name="linknoteref-0131"       id="linknoteref-0131">0131</a> and were nearly identical in form with the
      letters used anciently by the entire Hebrew race. The most ancient
      inscription in the character which has come down to us is probably that of
      Mesha,<a href="#linknote-0132" name="linknoteref-0132"       id="linknoteref-0132">0132</a> the Moabite king, which belongs to the
      ninth century before our era. The next in antiquity, which is of any
      considerable length, is that discovered recently in the aqueduct which
      brings the water into the pool of Siloam,<a href="#linknote-0133"       name="linknoteref-0133" id="linknoteref-0133">0133</a> which dates
      probably from the time of Hezekiah, ab. B.C. 727-699. Some short epigraphs
      on Assyrian gems, tablets, and cylinders belong apparently to about the
      same period. The series of Phoenician and Cilician coins begins soon after
      this, and continues to the time of the Roman supremacy in Western Asia.
      The soil of Phoenicia Proper, and of the various countries where the
      Phoenicians established settlements or factories, as Cyprus, Malta,
      Sicily, Sardinia, Southern Gaul, Spain, and North Africa, has also yielded
      a large crop of somewhat brief legends, the &ldquo;inscription of Marseilles"<a
      href="#linknote-0134" name="linknoteref-0134" id="linknoteref-0134">0134</a>
      being the most important of them. Finally there have been found within the
      last few years, in Phoenicia itself, near Byblus and Sidon, the three most
      valuable inscriptions of the entire series&mdash;those of Jehavmelek,
      Esmunazar and Tabnit&mdash;which have enabled scholars to place the whole
      subject on a scientific basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is now clear that the same, or nearly the same, alphabet was in use
      from a very early date over the greater part of Western Asia&mdash;in
      Phoenicia, Moab, Judæa, Samaria, Lycia, Caria, Phrygia, &amp;c.&mdash;that
      it was adopted, with slight alterations only, by the Etruscans and the
      Greeks, and that from them it was passed on to the nations of modern
      Europe, and acquired a quasi-universality. The invention of this alphabet
      was, by the general consent of antiquity, ascribed to the Phoenicians;<a
      href="#linknote-0135" name="linknoteref-0135" id="linknoteref-0135">0135</a>
      and though, if their claim to priority of discovery be disputed, it is
      impossible to prove it, their practical genius and their position among
      the nations of the earth are strong subsidiary arguments in support of the
      traditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Phoenician alphabet, or the Syrian script, as some call it,<a
      href="#linknote-0136" name="linknoteref-0136" id="linknoteref-0136">0136</a>
      did not obtain its general prevalence without possessing some peculiar
      merits. Its primary merit was that of simplicity. The pictorial systems of
      the Egyptians and the Hittites required a hand skilled in drawing to
      express them; the cuneiform syllabaries of Babylonia, Assyria, and Elam
      needed an extraordinary memory to grasp the almost infinite variety in the
      arrangement of the wedges, and to distinguish each group from all the
      rest; even the Cypriote syllabary was of awkward and unnecessary extent,
      and was expressed by characters needlessly complicated. The Phoenician
      inventor, whoever he was, reduced letters to the smallest possible number,
      and expressed them by the simplest possible forms. Casting aside the idea
      of a syllabary, he reduced speech to its ultimate elements, and set apart
      a single sign to represent each possible variety of articulation, or
      rather each variety of which he was individually cognisant. How he fixed
      upon his signs, it is difficult to say. According to some, he had recourse
      to one or other of previously existing modes of expressing speech, and
      merely simplified the characters which he found in use. But there are two
      objections to this view. First, there is no known set of characters from
      which the early Phoenician can be derived with any plausability.
      Resemblances no doubt may be pointed out here and there, but taking the
      alphabet as a whole, and comparing it with any other, the differences will
      always be quite as numerous and quite as striking as the similarities. For
      instance, the writer of the article on the &ldquo;Alphabet&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Encyclopædia
      Britannica&rdquo; (1876) derives the Phoenician letters from letters used in the
      Egyptian hieratic writing,<a href="#linknote-0137" name="linknoteref-0137"       id="linknoteref-0137">0137</a> but his own table shows a marked diversity
      in at least eleven instances, a slight resemblance in seven or eight, a
      strong resemblance in no more than two or three. Derivation from the
      Cypriote forms has been suggested by some; but here again eight letters
      are very different, if six or seven are similar. Recently, derivation from
      the Hittite hieroglyphs has been advocated,<a href="#linknote-0138"       name="linknoteref-0138" id="linknoteref-0138">0138</a> but the alleged
      instances of resemblance touch nine characters only out of the twenty-two.
      And real resemblance is confined to three or four. Secondly, no theory of
      derivation accounts for the Phoenician names of their letters, which
      designate objects quite different from those represented by the Egyptian
      hieroglyphs, and equally different from those represented by the Hittite
      letters. For instance, the Egyptian <i>a</i> is the ill-drawn figure of an
      eagle, the Phoenician <i>alef</i> has the signification of &ldquo;ox;&rdquo; the <i>b</i>
      of the Egyptians is a hastily drawn figure of a crane, the Phoenician <i>beth</i>
      means &ldquo;a house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the whole, it seems most probable that the Phoenicians began with their
      own hieroglyphical system, selecting an object to represent the initial
      sound of its name, and at first drawing that object, but that they very
      soon followed the Egyptian idea of representing the original drawing in a
      conventional way, by a few lines, straight or curved. Their hieroglyphic
      alphabet which is extant is an alphabet in the second stage, corresponding
      to the Egyptian hieratic, but not derived from it. Having originally
      represented their <i>alef</i> by an ox&rsquo;s head, they found a way of
      sufficiently indicating the head by three lines {...}, which marked the
      horns, the ears, and the face. Their <i>beth</i> was a house in the tent
      form; their <i>gimel</i> a camel, represented by its head and neck; their
      <i>daleth</i> a door, and so on. The object intended is not always
      positively known; but, where it is known, there is no difficulty in
      tracing the original picture in the later conventional sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Phoenician alphabet was not without its defects. The most remarkable
      of these was the absence of any characters expressive of vowel sounds. The
      Phoenician letters are, all of them, consonants; and the reader is
      expected to supply the vowel sounds for himself. There was not even any
      system of pointing, so far as we know, whereby, as in Hebrew and Arabic,
      the proper sounds were supplied. Again, several letters were made to serve
      for two sounds, as <i>beth</i> for both <i>b</i> and <i>v</i>, <i>pe</i>
      for both <i>p</i> and <i>f</i>, <i>shin</i> for both <i>s</i> and <i>sh</i>,
      and <i>tau</i> for both <i>t</i> and <i>th</i>. There were no forms
      corresponding to the sounds <i>j</i> or <i>w</i>. On the other hand, there
      was in the alphabet a certain amount of redundancy. <i>Tsade</i> is
      superfluous, since it represents, not a simple elemental sound, but a
      combination of two sounds, <i>t</i> and <i>s</i>. Hence the Greeks omitted
      it, as did also the Oscans and the Romans. There is redundancy in the two
      forms for <i>k</i>, namely <i>kaph</i> and <i>koph</i>; in the two for <i>t</i>,
      namely <i>teth</i> and <i>tau</i>; and in the two for <i>s</i>, namely <i>samech</i>
      and <i>shin</i>. But no alphabet is without some imperfections, either in
      the way of excess or defect; and perhaps we ought to be more surprised
      that the Phoenician alphabet has not more faults than that it falls so far
      short of perfection as it does.
    </p>
    <p>
      The writing of the Phoenicians was, like that of the majority of the
      Semitic nations, from right to left. The reverse order was entirely
      unknown to them, whether employed freely as an alternative, as in Egypt,
      or confined, as in Greece, to the alternate lines. The words were, as a
      general rule, undivided, and even in some instances were carried over the
      end of one line into the beginning of another. Still, there are examples
      where a sign of separation occurs between each word and the next;<a
      href="#linknote-0139" name="linknoteref-0139" id="linknoteref-0139">0139</a>
      and the general rule is, that the words do not run over the line. In the
      later inscriptions they are divided, according to the modern fashion, by a
      blank space;<a href="#linknote-1310" name="linknoteref-1310"       id="linknoteref-1310">1310</a> but there seems to have been an earlier
      practice of dividing them by small triangles or by dots.
    </p>
    <p>
      The language of the Phoenicians was very close indeed to the Hebrew, both
      as regards roots and as regards grammatical forms. The number of known
      words is small, since not only are the inscriptions few and scanty, but
      they treat so much of the same matters, and run so nearly in the same
      form, that, for the most part, the later ones contain nothing new but the
      proper names. Still they make known to us a certain number of words in
      common use, and these are almost always either identical with the Hebrew
      forms, or very slightly different from them, as the following table will
      demonstrate:&mdash;

    <p>
      The Phoenician numerals, so far as they are known to us, are identical, or
      nearly identical, with the Hebrew. <i>&rsquo;Ahad</i> {...} is &ldquo;one;&rdquo; <i>shen</i>
      {...}, &ldquo;two;&rdquo; <i>shalish</i> {...}, &ldquo;three;&rdquo; <i>arba</i> {...}, &ldquo;four;&rdquo; <i>hamesh</i>
      {...}, &ldquo;five;&rdquo; <i>eshman</i> {...}, &ldquo;eight;&rdquo; <i>&rsquo;eser</i> {...}, &ldquo;ten;&rdquo;
       and so on. Numbers were, however, by the Phoenicians ordinarily expressed
      by signs, not words&mdash;the units by perpendicular lines: | for &ldquo;one,&rdquo;
       || for &ldquo;two,&rdquo; ||| for &ldquo;three,&rdquo; and the like; the tens by horizontal ones,
      either simple, {...}, or hooked at the right end, {...}; twenty by a sign
      resembling a written capital <i>n</i>, {...}; one hundred by a sign still
      more complicated, {...}.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grammatical inflexions, the particles, the pronouns, and the
      prepositions are also mostly identical. The definite article is expressed,
      as in Hebrew, by <i>h</i> prefixed. Plurals are formed by the addition of
      <i>m</i> or <i>th</i>. The prefix <i>eth</i> {...} marks the accusative.
      There is a <i>niphal</i> conjugation, formed by prefixing <i>n</i>. The
      full personal pronouns are <i>anak</i> {...} = &ldquo;I&rdquo; (compare Heb. {...});
      <i>hu</i> {...}, &ldquo;he&rdquo; (compare Heb. {...}); <i>hi</i> {...}, &ldquo;she&rdquo;
       (compare Heb. {...}); <i>anachnu</i>, &ldquo;we&rdquo; (compare Heb. {...}); and the
      suffixed pronouns are <i>-i</i>, &ldquo;me, my;&rdquo; <i>-ka</i>, &ldquo;thee, thy;&rdquo; <i>-h</i>
      (pronounced as <i>-oh</i> or <i>-o</i>), &ldquo;him, his&rdquo; (compare Heb. {...});
      <i>-n</i> &ldquo;our,&rdquo; perhaps pronounced <i>nu</i>; and <i>-m</i>, &ldquo;their,
      them,&rdquo; pronounced <i>om</i> or <i>um</i> (compare Heb. {...}). <i>Vau</i>
      prefixed means &ldquo;and;&rdquo; <i>beth</i> prefixed &ldquo;in;&rdquo; <i>kaph</i> prefixed
      &ldquo;as;&rdquo; <i>lamed</i> prefixed &ldquo;of&rdquo; or &ldquo;to;&rdquo; <i>&rsquo;al</i> {...} is &ldquo;over;&rdquo; <i>ki</i>
      {...} &ldquo;because;&rdquo; <i>im</i> {...}, &ldquo;if;&rdquo; <i>hazah</i>, <i>zath</i>, or <i>za</i>
      {...}, &ldquo;this&rdquo; (compare Heb. {...}); and <i>ash</i> {...}, &ldquo;who, which&rdquo;
       (compare Heb. {...}). <i>Al</i> {...} and <i>lo</i> {...} are the
      negatives (compare Heb. {...}). The redundant use of the personal pronoun
      with the relative is common.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, Phoenician is not mere Hebrew; it has its own genius, its idioms,
      its characteristics. The definite article, so constantly recurring in
      Hebrew, is in Phoenician, comparatively speaking, rare. The quiescent
      letters, which in Hebrew ordinarily accompany the long vowels, are in
      Phoenician for the most part absent. The employment of the participle for
      the definite tenses of the verb is much more common in Phoenician than in
      Hebrew, and the Hebrew prefix <i>m</i> is wanting. The ordinary
      termination of feminine singular nouns is <i>-th</i>, not <i>-h</i>.
      Peculiar forms occur, as <i>ash</i> for <i>asher</i>, <i>&rsquo;amath</i> for <i>&rsquo;am</i>
      (&ldquo;people&rdquo;), <i>zan</i> for <i>zah</i> (&ldquo;this&rdquo;), &amp;c. Words which in
      Hebrew are confined to poetry pass among the Phoenicians into ordinary
      use, as <i>pha&rsquo;al</i> ({...}, Heb. {...}), &ldquo;to make,&rdquo; which replaces the
      Hebrew {...}.<a href="#linknote-1311" name="linknoteref-1311"       id="linknoteref-1311">1311</a>

      &ldquo;It is strange,&rdquo; says M. Renan, &ldquo;that the people to which all antiquity
      attributes the invention of writing, and which has, beyond all doubted,
      transmitted it to the entire civilised world, has scarcely left us any
      literature."<a href="#linknote-1312" name="linknoteref-1312"       id="linknoteref-1312">1312</a> Certainly it is difficult to give the name
      of literature either to the fragments of so-called Phoenician works
      preserved to us in Greek translations, or to the epigraphic remains of
      actual Phoenician writing which have come down to our day. The works are
      two, and two only, viz. the pretended &ldquo;Phoenician History&rdquo; of
      Sanchoniathon, and the &ldquo;Periplus&rdquo; of Hanno. Of the former, it is perhaps
      sufficient to say that we have no evidence of its genuineness. Philo of
      Byblus, who pretends that he translated it from a Phoenician original,
      though possibly he had Phoenician blood in his veins, was a Greek in
      language, in temperament, and in tone of thought, and belonged to the
      Greece which is characterised by Juvenal as &ldquo;Græcia mendax.&rdquo; It is
      impossible to believe that the Euemerism in which he indulges, and which
      was evidently the motive of his work, sprang from the brain of
      Sanchoniathon nine hundred years before Euemerus existed. One is tempted
      to suspect that Sanchoniathan himself was a myth&mdash;an &ldquo;idol of the
      cave,&rdquo; evolved out of the inner consciousness of Philo. Philo had a
      certain knowledge of the Phoenician language, and of the Phoenician
      religious system, but not more than he might have gained by personal
      communication with the priests of Byblus and Aphaca, who maintained the
      old worship in, and long after, his day. It is not clear that he drew his
      statements from any ancient authorities, or from books at all. So far as
      the extant fragments go, a smattering of the language, a very moderate
      acquaintance with the religion, and a little imagination might readily
      have produced them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few extracts from the remains must be given to justify this judgement:&mdash;&ldquo;The
      beginning of all things,&rdquo; Philo says,<a href="#linknote-1313"       name="linknoteref-1313" id="linknoteref-1313">1313</a> &ldquo;was a dark and
      stormy air, or a dark air and a turbid chaos, resembling Erebus; and these
      were at first unbounded, and for a long series of ages had no limit. But
      after a time this wind became enamoured of its own first principles, and
      an intimate union took place between them, a connection which was called
      Desire {pothos}: and this was the beginning of the creation of all things.
      But it (i.e. the Desire) had no consciousness of its own creation:
      however, from its embrace with the wind was generated Môt, which some call
      watery slime, and others putrescence of watery secretion. And from this
      sprang all the seed of creation, and the generation of the universe. And
      first there were certain animals without sensation, from which intelligent
      animals were produced, and these were called &lsquo;Zopher-Sêmin,&rsquo; i.e.
      &lsquo;beholders of the heavens;&rsquo; and they were made in the shape of an egg, and
      from Môt shone forth the sun, and the moon, and the lesser and the greater
      stars. And when the air began to send forth light, by the conflagration of
      land and sea, winds were produced, and clouds, and very great downpours,
      and effusions of the heavenly waters. And when these were thus separated,
      and carried, through the heat of the sun, out of their proper places, and
      all met again in the air, and came into collision, there ensued
      thunderings and lightnings; and through the rattle of the thunder, the
      intelligent animals, above mentioned, were woke up, and, startled by the
      noise, began to move about both in the sea and on the land, alike such as
      were male and such as were female. All these things were found in the
      cosmogony of Taaut (Thoth), and in his Commentaries, and were drawn from
      his conjectures, and from the proofs which his intellect discovered, and
      which he made clear to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again, &ldquo;From the wind, Colpia, and his wife Bahu (Heb. {...}), which is by
      interpretation &lsquo;Night,&rsquo; were born Æon and Protogonus, mortal men so named;
      of whom one, viz. Æon, discovered that life might be sustained by the
      fruits of trees. Their immediate descendants were called Genos and Genea,
      who lived in Phoenicia, and in time of drought stretched forth their hands
      to heaven towards the sun; for him they regarded as the sole Lord of
      Heaven, and called him Baal-samin, which means &lsquo;Lord of Heaven&rsquo; in the
      Phoenician tongue, and is equivalent to Zeus in Greek. And from Genos, son
      of Æon and Protogonus, were begotten mortal children, called Phôs, and
      Pyr, and Phlox (i.e. Light, Fire, and Flame). These persons invented the
      method of producing fire by rubbing two pieces of wood together, and
      taught men to employ it. They begat sons of surprising size and stature,
      whose names were given to the mountains whereof they had obtained
      possession, viz. Casius, and Libanus, and Antilibanus, and Brathy. From
      them were produced Memrumus and Hypsuranius, who took their names from
      their mothers, women in those days yielding themselves without shame to
      any man whom they happened to meet. Hypsuranius lived at Tyre, and
      invented the art of building huts with reeds and rushes and the papyrus
      plant. He quarrelled with his brother, Usôus, who was the first to make
      clothing for the body out of the skins of the wild beasts which he slew.
      On one occasion, when there was a great storm of rain and wind, the trees
      in the neighbourhood of Tyre so rubbed against each other that they took
      fire, and the whole forest was burnt; whereupon Usôus took a tree, and
      having cleared it of its boughs, was the first to venture on the sea in a
      boat. He also consecrated two pillars to Fire and Wind, and worshipped
      them, and poured upon them the blood of the animals which he took by
      hunting. And when the two brothers were dead, those who remained alive
      consecrated rods to their memory, and continued to worship the pillars,
      and to hold a festival in their honour year by year."<a

    <p>
      Once more&mdash;&ldquo;It was the custom among the ancients, in times of great
      calamity and danger, for the rulers of the city or nation to avert the
      ruin of all by sacrificing to the avenging deities the best beloved of
      their children as the price of redemption; and such as were thus devoted
      were offered with mystic ceremonies. Kronus, therefore, who was called El
      by the Phoenicians, and who, after his death, was deified and attached to
      the planet which bears his name, having an only son by a nymph of the
      country, who was called Anobret, took his son, whose name was Ieoud, which
      means &lsquo;only son&rsquo; in Phoenician, and when a great danger from war impended
      over the land, adorned him with the ensigns of royalty, and, having
      prepared an altar for the purpose, voluntarily sacrificed him."<a
      href="#linknote-1315" name="linknoteref-1315" id="linknoteref-1315">1315</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be seen from these extracts that the literary value of Philo&rsquo;s
      work was exceedingly small. His style is complicated and confused; his
      matter, for the most part, worthless, and his mixture of Greek,
      Phoenician, and Egyptian etymologies absurd. If we were bound to believe
      that he translated a real Phoenician original, and that that original was
      a fair specimen of Phoenician literary talent, the only conclusion to
      which we could come would be, that the literature of the nation was
      beneath contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the &ldquo;Periplus&rdquo; of Hanno will lead us to modify this judgment. It is so
      short a work that we venture to give it entire from the translation of
      Falconer,<a href="#linknote-1316" name="linknoteref-1316"       id="linknoteref-1316">1316</a> with a few obvious corrections.

      The voyage of Hanno, King of the Carthaginians, round the parts of Libya
      beyond the Pillars of Hercules, which he deposited in the Temple of
      Kronos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was decreed by the Carthaginians that Hanno should undertake a voyage
      beyond the Pillars of Hercules, and there found Liby-Phoenician cities. He
      sailed accordingly with sixty ships of fifty oars each, and a body of men
      and women, to the number of thirty thousand, and provisions, and other
      necessaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we had weighed anchor, and passed the Pillars, and sailed beyond
      them for two days, we founded the first city, which we named Thymiaterium.
      Below it lay an extensive plain. Proceeding thence towards the west, we
      came to Soloeis, a promontory of Libya thickly covered with trees, where
      we erected a temple to Neptune (Poseidon), and again proceeded for the
      space of half a day towards the east, until we arrived at a lake lying not
      far from the sea, and filled with abundance of large reeds. Here elephants
      and a great number of other wild animals were feeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Having passed the lake about a day&rsquo;s sail, we founded cities near the
      sea, called Caricon-Teichos, and Gytta, and Acra, and Melitta, and
      Arambys. Thence we came to the great river Lixus, which flows from Libya.
      On its banks the Lixitæ, a wandering tribe, were feeding flocks, amongst
      whom we continued some time on friendly terms. Beyond the Lixitæ dwelt the
      inhospitable Ethiopians, who pasture a wild country intersected by large
      mountains, from which they say the river Lixus flows. In the neighbourhood
      of the mountains lived the Troglodytes, men of various appearances, whom
      the Lixitæ described as swifter in running than horses. Having procured
      interpreters from them, we coasted along a desert country towards the
      south for two days; and thence again proceeded towards the east the course
      of a day. Here we found in the recess of a certain bay a small island,
      having a circuit of five stadia, where we settled a colony, and called it
      Cerne. We judged from our voyage that this place lay in a direct line with
      Carthage; for the length of our voyage from Carthage to the Pillars was
      equal to that from the Pillars to Cerne. We then came to a cape, which we
      reached by sailing up a large river called Chrete. The lake had three
      islands larger than Cerne; from which, proceeding a day&rsquo;s sail, we came to
      the extremity of the lake. This was overhung by huge mountains, inhabited
      by savage men, clothed in skins of wild beasts, who drove us away by
      throwing stones, and hindered us from landing. Sailing thence, we came to
      another river, that was deep and broad, and full of crocodiles and river
      horses (hippopotami), whence returning back, we came again to Cerne.
      Thence we sailed towards the south for twelve days, coasting along the
      shore, the whole of which is inhabited by Ethiopians, who would not wait
      our approach, but fled from us. Their language was unintelligible, even to
      the Lixitæ who were with us. On the last day we approached some large
      mountains covered with trees, the wood of which was sweet-scented and
      variegated. Having sailed by these mountains for two days, we came to an
      immense opening of the sea; on each side of which, towards the continent,
      was a plain; from which we saw by night fire arising at intervals, either
      more or less.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Having taken in water there, we sailed forward during five days near the
      land, until we came to a large bay, which our interpreter informed us was
      called &lsquo;the Western Horn.&rsquo; In this was a large island, and in the island a
      salt-water lake, and in this another island, where, when we had landed, we
      could discover nothing in the daytime except trees; but in the night we
      saw many fires burning, and heard the sound of pipes, cymbals, drums, and
      confused shouting. We were then afraid, and our diviners ordered us to
      abandon the island. Sailing quickly away thence, we passed by a country
      burning with fires and perfumes; and streams of fire supplied thence fell
      into the sea. The country was untraversable on account of the heat. So we
      sailed away quickly from there also, being much terrified; and, passing on
      for four days, we observed at night a country full of flames. In the
      middle was a lofty fire, larger than the rest, which seemed to touch the
      stars. When day came, we discovered it to be a huge hill, called &lsquo;the
      Chariot of the Gods.&rsquo; On the third day after our departure thence, after
      sailing by streams of fire, we arrived at a bay, called &lsquo;the Southern
      Horn;&rsquo; at the bottom of which lay an island like the former one, having a
      lake, and in the lake another island full of savage people, far the
      greater part of whom were women, whose bodies were hairy, and whom our
      interpreters called &lsquo;gorillæ.&rsquo; Though we pursued the men, we could not
      catch any of them; but all escaped us, climbing over the precipices, and
      defending themselves with stones. Three women were, however, taken; but
      they attacked their conductors with their teeth and nails, and could not
      be prevailed upon to accompany us. So we killed them, and flayed them, and
      brought their skins with us to Carthage. We did not sail further on, our
      provisions failing us.&rdquo;

      The style of this short work, though exceedingly simple and inartificial,
      is not without its merits. It has the directness, the perspicuity, and the
      liveliness of Cæsar&rsquo;s Commentaries or of the Duke of Wellington&rsquo;s
      Despatches. Montesquieu<a href="#linknote-1317" name="linknoteref-1317"       id="linknoteref-1317">1317</a> says of it:&mdash;&ldquo;Hanno&rsquo;s Voyage was
      written by the very man who performed it. His recital is not mingled with
      ostentation. Great commanders write their actions with simplicity, because
      they receive more honour from facts than words.&rdquo; If we may take the work
      as a specimen of the accounts which Phoenician explorers commonly gave of
      their travels in unknown regions, we must regard them as having set a
      pattern which modern travellers would do well to follow. Hanno gives us
      facts, not speculations&mdash;the things which he has observed, not those
      of which he has dreamt; and he delivers his facts in the fewest possible
      words, and in the plainest possible way. He does not cultivate flowers of
      rhetoric; he does not unduly spin out his narrative. It is plain that he
      is especially bent on making his meaning clear, and he succeeds in doing
      so.

      The epigraphic literature of the Phoenicians, which M. Renan considers to
      supply fairly well the almost complete loss of their books,<a
      href="#linknote-1318" name="linknoteref-1318" id="linknoteref-1318">1318</a>
      scarcely deserves to be so highly rated. It consists at present of five or
      six moderately long, and some hundreds of exceedingly short, inscriptions;
      the longer ones being, all of them, inscribed on stones, the shorter on
      stones, vases, pateræ, gems, coins, and the like. The longest of all is
      that engraved on the sarcophagus of Esmunazar, king of Sidon, discovered
      near the modern Saida in the year 1855, and now in the museum of the
      Louvre. This has a length of twenty-two long lines, and contains 298
      words.<a href="#linknote-1319" name="linknoteref-1319"       id="linknoteref-1319">1319</a> It is fairly legible throughout; and the
      sense is, for the most part, fairly well ascertained, though the meaning
      of some passages remains still more or less doubtful. The following is the
      translation of M. Renan:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the month of Bul (October), in the fourteenth year of the reign of
      King Esmunazar, king of the Sidonians, son of King Tabnit, king of the
      Sidonians, King Esmunazar, king of the Sidonians, spake, saying&mdash;I am
      snatched away before my time, the child of a few days, the orphan son of a
      widow; and lo! I am lying in this coffin, and in this tomb, in the place
      which I have built. I adjure every royal personage and every man
      whatsoever, that they open not this my chamber, and seek not for treasures
      there, since there are here no treasures, and that they remove not the
      coffin from my chamber, nor build over this my chamber any other funeral
      chamber. Even if men speak to thee, listen not to their words; since every
      royal personage and every other man who shall open this funeral chamber,
      or remove the coffin from this my chamber, or build anything over this
      chamber&mdash;may they have no funeral chamber with the departed, nor be
      buried in tombs, nor have any son or descendant to succeed to their place;
      but may the Holy Gods deliver them into the hand of a mighty king who
      shall reign over them, and destroy the royal personage or the man who
      shall open this my funeral chamber, or remove this coffin, together with
      the offspring of the royal personage or other man, and let them not have
      either root below, or any fruit above, or glory among such as live beneath
      the sun. Since I am snatched away before my time, the child of a few days,
      the orphan son of a widow, even I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For I am Esmunazar, king of the Sidonians, the son of King Tabnit, king
      of the Sidonians, and the grandson of Esmunazar, king of the Sidonians,
      and my mother is Am-Ashtoreth, priestess of our lady Ashtoreth, the queen,
      the daughter of King Esmunazar, king of the Sidonians&mdash;and it is we
      who have built the temples of the gods, the temple of Ashtoreth in Sidon
      on the shore of the sea, and have placed Ashtoreth in her temple to
      glorify her; and we too have built the temple of Esmun, and set the sacred
      grove, En Yidlal, in the mountain, and made him (Esmun) dwell there to
      glorify him; and it is we who have built temples to the [other] deities of
      the Sidonians, in Sidon on the shore of the sea, as the temple of
      Baal-Sidon, and the temple of Asthoreth, who bears the name of Baal. And
      for this cause has the Lord of Kings given us Dor and Joppa, and the
      fertile cornlands which are in the plains of Sharon, as a reward for the
      great things which I have done, and added them to the boundaries of the
      land, that they may belong to the Sidonians for ever. I adjure every royal
      personage, and every man whatsoever, that they open not this my chamber,
      nor empty my chamber, nor build aught over this my chamber, nor remove the
      coffin from this my chamber, lest the Holy Gods deliver them up, and
      destroy the royal personage, or the men [who shall do so], and their
      offspring for ever."<a href="#linknote-1320" name="linknoteref-1320"       id="linknoteref-1320">1320</a>

      The inscription on the tomb of Tabnit, Esmunazar&rsquo;s father, found near
      Beyrout in 1886, is shorter, but nearly to the same effect. It has been
      thus translated:&mdash;&ldquo;I, Tabnit, priest of Ashtoreth, and king of Sidon,
      lying in this tomb, say&mdash;I adjure every man, when thou shalt come
      upon this sepulchre, open not my chamber, and trouble me not, for there is
      not with me aught of silver, nor is there with me aught of gold, there is
      not with me anything whatever of spoil, but only I myself who lie in this
      sepulchre. Open not my chamber, and trouble me not; for it would be an
      abomination in the sight of Ashtoreth to do such an act. And if thou
      shouldest open my chamber, and trouble me, mayest thou have no posterity
      all thy life under the sun, and no resting-place with the departed."<a

      A stelé of a Byblian king, Jehavmelek, probably somewhat more ancient than
      these,<a href="#linknote-1322" name="linknoteref-1322"       id="linknoteref-1322">1322</a> bears an inscription of a different kind,
      since it is attached to a votive offering and not to a sepulchre. The king
      represents himself in a bas-relief as making an offering to Beltis or
      Ashtoreth, and then appends an epigraph, which runs to fifteen long lines,<a
      href="#linknote-1323" name="linknoteref-1323" id="linknoteref-1323">1323</a>
      and is to the following effect:&mdash;&ldquo;I am Jehavmelek, king of Gebal, the
      son of Jahar-baal, and the grandson of Adom-melek, king of Gebal, whom
      lady Beltis of Gebal has made king of Gebal; and I invoke my lady Beltis
      of Gebal, because she has heard my voice. And I have made for my lady
      Beltis of Gebal the brazen altar which is in this temple, and the golden
      carving which is in front of this my carving, and the uræus of gold which
      is in the middle of the stone over the golden carving. And I have made
      this portico, with its columns, and the capitals that are upon the
      columns, and the roof of the temple also, I, Jehavmelek, king of Gebal,
      have made for my lady Beltis of Gebal, because, whenever I have invoked my
      lady Beltis of Gebal, she has heard my voice, and been good to me. May
      Beltis of Gebal bless Jehavmelek, king of Gebal, and grant him life, and
      prolong his days and his years over Gebal, because he is a just king; and
      may the lady Beltis of Gebal obtain him favour in the sight of the Gods,
      and in the sight of the people of foreign lands, for ever! Every royal
      personage and every other man who shall make additions to this altar, or
      to this golden carving, or to this portico, I, Jehavmelek, king of Gebal,
      set may face against him who shall so do, and I pray my lady Beltis of
      Gebal to destroy that man, whoever he be, and his seed after him."<a

      The inscription of Marseilles, if it had been entire, would have been as
      valuable and interesting as any of these; but, unfortunately, its
      twenty-one lines are in every case incomplete, being broken off, or else
      illegible, towards the left. It appears to have been a decree emanating
      from the authorities of Carthage, and prescribing the amount of the
      payments to be made in connection with the sacrifices and officials of a
      temple of Baal which may have existed either at Marseilles or at Carthage
      itself. To translate it is impossible without a vast amount of conjecture;
      but M. Renan&rsquo;s version<a href="#linknote-1325" name="linknoteref-1325"       id="linknoteref-1325">1325</a> seems to deserve a place in the present

      Of the shorter inscriptions of the Phoenicians, by far the greater number
      were attached either to votive offerings or to tombs. Some hundreds have
      been found of both classes, but they are almost wholly without literary
      merit, being bald and jejune in the extreme, and presenting little
      variety. The depositor of a votive offering usually begins by mentioning
      the name and title, or titles, of the deity to whom he dedicates it. Then
      he appends his own name, with the names of his father and grandfather.
      Occasionally, but rarely, he describes his offering, and states the year
      in which it was set up. Finally, he asks the deity to bless him. The
      following are examples:&mdash;

      180th year of the Lord of Kings, and in the 143rd year of the people of
      Tyre, that it might be to me a memorial and for a good name beneath the

      There is a little more variety in the inscriptions on tombstones. The
      great majority, indeed, are extremely curt and dry, containing scarcely
      anything beyond the name of the person who is buried in the tomb, or that
      together with the name of the person by whom the monument is erected; e.g.
      &ldquo;To Athad, the daughter of Abd-Esmun, the Suffes, and wife of
      Ger-Melkarth, the son of Ben-hodesh, the son of Esmunazar"<a
      href="#linknote-1331" name="linknoteref-1331" id="linknoteref-1331">1331</a>;

      the son of Abd-Susim, the son of Hur, have erected this monument, while I
      am still alive, to myself, and to my wife, Ammat-Ashtoreth, daughter of
      Taam, son of Abd-melek, [and have placed it] over the chamber of my tomb,
      in perpetuity."<a href="#linknote-1333" name="linknoteref-1333"       id="linknoteref-1333">1333</a> But, occasionally, we get a glimpse, beyond
      the mere dry facts, into the region of thought; as where the erector of a
      monument appends to the name of one, whom we may suppose to have been a
      miser, the remark, that &ldquo;the reward of him who heaps up riches is
      contempt;"<a href="#linknote-1334" name="linknoteref-1334"       id="linknoteref-1334">1334</a> or where one who entertains the hope that
      his friend is happier in another world than he was upon earth, thus
      expresses himself&mdash;&ldquo;In memory of Esmun. After rain, the sun shines
      forth;"<a href="#linknote-1335" name="linknoteref-1335"       id="linknoteref-1335">1335</a> or, again, where domestic affection shows
      itself in the declaration concerning the departed&mdash;&ldquo;When he entered
      into the house that is so full [of guests], there was grief for the memory
      of the sage, the man that was hard as adamant, that bore calamities of
      every sort, that was a widower through the death of my mother, that was
      like a pellucid fountain, and had a name pure from crime. Erected in

      With respect to the extent and range of the Phoenician book literature,
      the little that can be gathered from the notices remaining to us in the
      Greek and Roman writers is the following. In Phoenicia Proper there were
      historical writers at least from the time of Hiram, the contemporary of
      David, who wrote the annals of their country in a curt dry form somewhat
      resembling that of Kings and Chronicles.<a href="#linknote-1337"       name="linknoteref-1337" id="linknoteref-1337">1337</a> The names of the
      kings and the length of their reigns were carefully recorded, together
      with some of the more remarkable events belonging to each reign; but there
      was no attempt at the philosophy of history, nor at the graces of
      composition. In some places, especially at Sidon, philosophy and science
      were to a certain extent cultivated. Mochus, a Sidonian, wrote a work on
      the atomic theory at a very early date, though scarcely, as Posidonius
      maintained,<a href="#linknote-1338" name="linknoteref-1338"       id="linknoteref-1338">1338</a> one anterior to the Trojan war. Later on,
      the Sidonian school specially affected astronomy and arithmetic, in which
      they made so much progress that the Greeks acknowledged themselves their
      debtors in those branches of knowledge.<a href="#linknote-1339"       name="linknoteref-1339" id="linknoteref-1339">1339</a> It is highly
      probable, though not exactly capable of proof, that the Tyrian navigators
      from a very remote period embodied in short works the observations which
      they made in their voyages, on the geography, hydrography, ethology, and
      natural history of the counties, which were visited by them. Hanno&rsquo;s
      &ldquo;Periplus&rdquo; may have been composed on a model of these earlier treatises,
      which at a later date furnished materials to Marinus for his great work on
      geography. It was, however, in the Phoenician colony of Carthage that
      authorship was taken up with most spirit and success. Hiempsal, Hanno,
      Mago, Hamilcar, and others, composed works, which the Romans valued
      highly, on the history, geography, and &ldquo;origines&rdquo; of Africa, and also upon
      practical agriculture.<a href="#linknote-1340" name="linknoteref-1340"       id="linknoteref-1340">1340</a> Mago and Hamilcar were regarded as the best
      authorities on the latter subject both by the Greeks and Romans, and were
      followed, among the Greeks by Mnaseas and Paxamus,<a href="#linknote-1341"       name="linknoteref-1341" id="linknoteref-1341">1341</a> among the Romans by
      Varro and Columella.<a href="#linknote-1342" name="linknoteref-1342"       id="linknoteref-1342">1342</a> So highly was the work of Mago, which ran
      to twenty-eight books, esteemed, that, on the taking of Carthage, it was
      translated into Latin by order of the Roman Senate.<a href="#linknote-1343"       name="linknoteref-1343" id="linknoteref-1343">1343</a> After the fall of
      Carthage, Tyre and Sidon once more became seats of learning; but the
      Phoenician language was discarded, and Greek adopted in its place. The
      Tyrian, Sidonian, Byblian and Berytian authors, of whom we hear, bear
      Greek names:<a href="#linknote-1344" name="linknoteref-1344"       id="linknoteref-1344">1344</a> and it is impossible to say whether they
      belonged, in any true sense, to the Phoenician race. Philo of Byblus and
      Marinus of Tyre are the only two authors of this later period who held to
      Phoenician traditions, and, presumably, conveyed on to later ages
      Phoenician ideas and accumulations. If neither literature nor science
      gained much from the work of the former, that of the latter had
      considerable value, and, as the basis of the great work of Ptolemy, must
      ever hold an honourable place in the history of geographical progress.

      When the Phoenician immigrants, in scattered bands, and at longer or
      shorter intervals, arrived upon the Syrian coast, and finding it empty
      occupied it, or wrested it from its earlier possessors, there was a
      decided absence from among them of any single governing or controlling
      authority; a marked tendency to assert and maintain separate rule and
      jurisdiction. Sidon, the Arkite, the Arvadite, the Zemarite, are
      separately enumerated in the book of Genesis;<a href="#linknote-0141"       name="linknoteref-0141" id="linknoteref-0141">0141</a> and the Hebrews
      have not even any one name under which to comprise the commercial people
      settled upon their coast line,<a href="#linknote-0142"       name="linknoteref-0142" id="linknoteref-0142">0142</a> until we come to
      Gospel times, when the Greeks have brought the term &ldquo;Syro-Phoenician&rdquo; into
      use.<a href="#linknote-0143" name="linknoteref-0143" id="linknoteref-0143">0143</a>
      Elsewhere we hear of &ldquo;them of Sidon,&rdquo; &ldquo;them of Tyre,"<a
      href="#linknote-0144" name="linknoteref-0144" id="linknoteref-0144">0144</a>
      &ldquo;the Giblites,"<a href="#linknote-0145" name="linknoteref-0145"       id="linknoteref-0145">0145</a> &ldquo;the men of Arvad,"<a href="#linknote-0146"       name="linknoteref-0146" id="linknoteref-0146">0146</a> &ldquo;the Arkites,&rdquo; &ldquo;the
      Sinites,&rdquo; &ldquo;the Zemarites,"<a href="#linknote-0147" name="linknoteref-0147"       id="linknoteref-0147">0147</a> &ldquo;the inhabitants of Accho, of Achzib, and
      Aphek,"<a href="#linknote-0148" name="linknoteref-0148"       id="linknoteref-0148">0148</a> but never of the whole maritime population
      north of Philistia under any single ethnic appellation. And the reason
      seems to be, that the Phoenicians, even more than the Greeks, affected a
      city autonomy. Each little band of immigrants, as soon as it had pushed
      its way into the sheltered tract between the mountains and the sea,
      settled itself upon some attractive spot, constructed habitations, and
      having surrounded its habitations with walls, claimed to be&mdash;and
      found none to dispute the claim&mdash;a distinct political entity. The
      conformation of the land, so broken up into isolated regions by strong
      spurs from Lebanon and Bargylus, lent additional support to the separatist
      spirit, and the absence in the early times of any pressure of danger from
      without permitted its free indulgence without entailing any serious
      penalty. It is difficult to say at what time the first settlements took
      place; but during the period of Egyptian supremacy over Western Asia,
      under the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties (ab. B.C. 1600-1350), we
      seem to find the Phoenicians in possession of the coast tract, and their
      cities severally in the enjoyment of independence and upon a
      quasi-equality. Tyre, Sidon, Gebal, Aradus, Simyra, Sarepta, Berytus, and
      perhaps Arka, appear in the inscriptions of Thothmes III,<a
      href="#linknote-0149" name="linknoteref-0149" id="linknoteref-0149">0149</a>
      and in the &ldquo;Travels of a Mohar,"<a href="#linknote-1410"       name="linknoteref-1410" id="linknoteref-1410">1410</a> without an
      indication of the pre-eminence, much less the supremacy, of any one of
      them. The towns pursued their courses independently one of another,
      submitting to the Egyptians when hard pressed, but always ready to
      reassert themselves, and never joining, so far as appears, in any league
      or confederation, by which their separate autonomy might have been
      endangered. During this period no city springs to any remarkable height of
      greatness or prosperity; material progress is, no doubt, being made by the
      nation; but it is not very marked, and it does not excite any particular
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      But with the decline of the Egyptian power, which sets in after the death
      of the second Rameses, a change takes place. External pressure being
      removed, ambitions begin to develop themselves. In the north Aradus
      (Arvad), in the south Sidon, proceed to exercise a sort of hegemony over
      several neighbouring states. Sidon becomes known as &ldquo;Great Zidon."<a
      href="#linknote-1411" name="linknoteref-1411" id="linknoteref-1411">1411</a>
      Not content with her maritime ascendancy, which was already pushing her
      into special notice, she aspired to a land dominion, and threw out
      offshoots from the main seat of her power as far as Laish, on the
      head-waters of the Jordan.<a href="#linknote-1412" name="linknoteref-1412"       id="linknoteref-1412">1412</a> It was her support, probably, which enabled
      the inhabitants of such comparatively weak cities as Accho and Achzib and
      Aphek to resist the invasion of the Hebrews, and maintain themselves,
      despite all attempts made to reduce them.<a href="#linknote-1413"       name="linknoteref-1413" id="linknoteref-1413">1413</a> At the same time
      she gradually extended her influence over the coast towns in her
      neighbourhood, as Sarepta, Heldun, perhaps Berytus, Ecdippa, and Accho.
      The period which succeeds that of Egyptian preponderance in Western Asia
      may be distinguished as that of Sidonian ascendancy, or of such ascendancy
      slightly modified by an Aradian hegemony in the north over the settlements
      intervening between Mount Casius and the northern roots of Lebanon.<a
      href="#linknote-1414" name="linknoteref-1414" id="linknoteref-1414">1414</a>
      During this period Sidon came to the front, alike in arts, in arms, and in
      navigation. Her vessels were found by the earliest Greek navigators in all
      parts of the Mediterranean into which they themselves ventured, and were
      known to push themselves into regions where no Greek dared to follow them.
      Under her fostering care Phoenician colonisation had spread over the whole
      of the Western Mediterranean, over the Ægean, and into the Propontis. She
      had engaged in war with the powerful nation of the Philistines, and,
      though worsted in the encounter, had obtained a reputation for audacity.
      By her wonderful progress in the arts, her citizens had acquired the
      epithet of {poludaidaloi},<a href="#linknote-1415" name="linknoteref-1415"       id="linknoteref-1415">1415</a> and had come to be recognised generally as
      the foremost artificers of the world in almost every branch of industry.
      Sidonian metal-work was particularly in repute. When Achilles at the
      funeral of Patroclus desired to offer as a prize to the fastest runner the
      most beautiful bowl that was to be found in all the world, he naturally
      chose one which had been deftly made by highly-skilled Sidonians, and
      which Phoenician sailors had conveyed in one of their hollow barks across
      the cloud-shadowed sea.<a href="#linknote-1416" name="linknoteref-1416"       id="linknoteref-1416">1416</a> When Menelaus proposed to present
      Telemachus, the son of his old comrade Odysseus, with what was at once the
      most beautiful and the most valuable of all his possessions, he selected a
      silver bowl with a golden rim, which in former days he had himself
      received as a present from Phædimus, the Sidonian king.<a
      href="#linknote-1417" name="linknoteref-1417" id="linknoteref-1417">1417</a>
      The sailors who stole Eumæus from Ortygia, and carried him across the sea
      to Ithica, obtained their prize by coming to his father&rsquo;s palace, and
      bringing with them, among other wares,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     . . . a necklace of fine gold to sell,
     With bright electron linked right wondrously and well.<a
      href="#linknote-1418" name="linknoteref-1418" id="linknoteref-1418">1418</a>
</pre>
    <p>
      Sidon&rsquo;s pre-eminence in the manufacture, the dyeing, and the embroidery of
      textile fabrics was at the same time equally unquestionable. Hecuba, being
      advised to offer to Athêné, on behalf of her favourite son, the best and
      loveliest of all the royal robes which her well-stored dress-chamber could
      furnish&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     She to her fragrant wardrobe bent her way,
     Where her rich veils in beauteous order lay;
     Webs by Sidonian virgins finely wrought,
     From Sidon&rsquo;s woofs by youthful Paris brought,
     When o&rsquo;er the boundless main the adulterer led
     Fair Helen from her home and nuptial bed;
     From these she chose the fullest, fairest far,
     With broidery bright, and blazing as a star.<a href="#linknote-1419"       name="linknoteref-1419" id="linknoteref-1419">1419</a>
</pre>
    <p>
      Already, it would seem, the precious shell-fish, on which Phoenicia&rsquo;s
      commerce so largely rested in later times, had been discovered; and it was
      the dazzling hue of the robe which constituted its especial value. Sidon
      was ultimately eclipsed by Tyre in the productions of the loom; and the
      unrivalled dye has come down to us, and will go down to all future ages,
      as &ldquo;<i>Tyrian</i> purple;&rdquo; but we may well believe that in this, as in
      most other matters on which prosperity and success depended, Tyre did but
      follow in the steps of her elder sister Sidon, perfecting possibly the
      manufacture which had been Sidon&rsquo;s discovery in the early ages. According
      to Scylax of Cadyanda, Dor was a Sidonian colony.<a href="#linknote-1420"       name="linknoteref-1420" id="linknoteref-1420">1420</a> Geographically it
      belonged rather to Philistia than to Phoenicia; but its possession of
      large stores of the purple fish caused its sudden seizure and rapid
      fortification at a very remote date, probably by the Phoenicians of Sidon.<a
      href="#linknote-1421" name="linknoteref-1421" id="linknoteref-1421">1421</a>
      It is quite possible that this aggression may have provoked that terrible
      war to which reference has already been made, between the Philistines
      under the hegemony of Ascalon and the first of the Phoenician cities.
      Ascalon attacked the Sidonians by land, blockaded the offending town, and
      after a time compelled a surrender; but the defenders had a ready retreat
      by sea, and, when they could no longer hold out against their assailants,
      took ship, and removed themselves to Tyre, which at the time was probably
      a dependency.<a href="#linknote-1422" name="linknoteref-1422"       id="linknoteref-1422">1422</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In navigation also and colonisation Sidon took the lead. According to
      some, she was the actual founder of Aradus, which was said to have owed
      its origin to a body of Sidonian exiles, who there settled themselves.<a
      href="#linknote-1423" name="linknoteref-1423" id="linknoteref-1423">1423</a>
      Not much reliance, however, can be placed on this tradition, which first
      appears in a writer of the Augustan age. With more confidence we may
      ascribe to Sidon the foundation of Citium in Cyprus, the colonisation of
      the islands in the Ægean, and of those Phoenician settlements in North
      Africa which were anterior to the founding of Carthage. It has even been
      supposed that the Sidonians were the first to make a settlement at
      Carthage itself,<a href="#linknote-1424" name="linknoteref-1424"       id="linknoteref-1424">1424</a> and that the Tyrian occupation under Dido
      was a recolonisation of an already occupied site. Anyhow, Sidon was the
      first to explore the central Mediterranean, and establish commercial
      relations with the barbarous tribes of the mid-African coast, Cabyles,
      Berbers, Shuloukhs, Tauriks, and others. She is thought to claim on a coin
      to be the mother-city of Melita, or Malta, as well as of Citium and
      Berytus;<a href="#linknote-1425" name="linknoteref-1425"       id="linknoteref-1425">1425</a> and, if this claim be allowed, we can
      scarcely doubt that she was also the first to plant colonies in Sicily.
      Further than this, it would seem, Sidonian enterprise did not penetrate.
      It was left for Tyre to discover the wealth of Southern Spain, to
      penetrate beyond the Straits of Gibraltar, and to affront the perils of
      the open ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, within the sphere indicated, Sidonian rovers traversed all parts of
      the Great Sea, penetrated into every gulf, became familiar sights to the
      inhabitants of every shore. From timid sailing along the coast by day,
      chiefly in the summer season, when winds whispered gently, and atmospheric
      signs indicated that fair weather had set in, they progressed by degrees
      to long voyages, continued both by night and day,<a href="#linknote-1426"       name="linknoteref-1426" id="linknoteref-1426">1426</a> from promontory to
      promontory, or from island to island, sometimes even across a long stretch
      of open sea, altogether out of sight of land, and carried on at every
      season of the year except some few of special danger. To Sidon is
      especially ascribed the introduction of the practice of sailing by night,<a
      href="#linknote-1427" name="linknoteref-1427" id="linknoteref-1427">1427</a>
      which shortened the duration of voyages by almost one-half, and doubled
      the number of trips that a vessel could accomplish in the course of a
      year. For night sailing the arts of astronomy and computation had to be
      studied;<a href="#linknote-1428" name="linknoteref-1428"       id="linknoteref-1428">1428</a> the aspect of the heavens at different
      seasons had to be known; and among the shifting constellations some fixed
      point had to be found by which it would be safe to steer. The last star in
      the tail of the Little Bear&mdash;the polar star of our own navigation
      books&mdash;was fixed upon by the Phoenicians, probably by the Sidonians,
      for this purpose,<a href="#linknote-1429" name="linknoteref-1429"       id="linknoteref-1429">1429</a> and was practically employed as the best
      index of the true north from a remote period. The rate of a ship&rsquo;s speed
      was, somehow or other, estimated; and though it was long before charts
      were made, or the set of currents taken into account, yet voyages were for
      the most part accomplished with very tolerable accuracy and safety. An
      ample commerce grew up under Sidonian auspices. After the vernal equinox
      was over a fleet of white-winged ships sped forth from the many harbours
      of the Syrian coast, well laden with a variety of wares&mdash;Phoenician,
      Assyrian, Egyptian<a href="#linknote-1430" name="linknoteref-1430"       id="linknoteref-1430">1430</a>&mdash;and made for the coasts and islands
      of the Levant, the Ægean, the Propontis, the Adriatic, the
      mid-Mediterranean, where they exchanged the cargoes which they had brought
      with them for the best products of the lands whereto they had come.
      Generally, a few weeks, or at most a month or two, would complete the
      transfer the of commodities, and the ships which left Sidon in April or
      May would return about June or July, unload, and make themselves ready for
      a second voyage. But sometimes, it appears, the return cargo was not so
      readily procured, and vessels had to remain in the foreign port, or
      roadstead, for the space of a whole year.<a href="#linknote-1431"       name="linknoteref-1431" id="linknoteref-1431">1431</a>

      The behaviour of the traders must, on the whole, have been such as won the
      respect of the nations and tribes wherewith they traded. Otherwise, the
      markets would soon have been closed against them, and, in lieu of the
      peaceful commerce which the Phoenicians always affected, would have sprung
      up along the shores of the Mediterranean a general feeling of distrust and
      suspicion, which would have led on to hostile encounters, surprises,
      massacres, and then reprisals. The entire history of Phoenician commerce
      shows that such a condition of things never existed. The traders and their
      customers were bound together by the bonds of self-interest, and, except
      in rare instances, dealt by each other fairly and honestly. Still, there
      were occasions when, under the stress of temptation, fair-dealing was lost
      sight of, and immediate prospect of gain was allowed to lead to the
      commission of acts destructive of all feeling of security, subversive of
      commercial morals, and calculated to effect a rupture of commercial
      relations, which it may often have taken a long term of years to
      re-establish. Herodotus tells us that, at a date considerably anterior to
      the Trojan war, when the ascendancy over the other Phoenician cities must
      certainly have belonged to Sidon, an affair of this kind took place on the
      coast of Argolis, which was long felt by the Greeks as an injury and an
      outrage. A Phoenician vessel made the coast near Argos, and the crew,
      having effected a landing, proceeded to expose their merchandise for sale
      along the shore, and to traffic with the natives, who were very willing to
      make purchases, and in the course of five or six days bought up almost the
      entire cargo. At length, just as the traders were thinking of re-embarking
      and sailing away, there came down to the shore from the capital a number
      of Argive ladies, including among them a princess, Io, the daughter of
      Inachus, the Argive king. Hereupon, the trafficking and the bargaining
      recommenced; goods were produced suited to the taste of the new customers;
      and each strove to obtain what she desired most at the least cost. But
      suddenly, as they were all intent upon their purchases, and were crowding
      round the stern of the ship, the Phoenicians, with a general shout, rushed
      upon them. Many&mdash;the greater part, we are told&mdash;made their
      escape; but the princess, and a certain number of her companions, were
      seized and carried on board. The traders quickly put to sea, and hoisting
      their sails, hurried away to Egypt.<a href="#linknote-1432"       name="linknoteref-1432" id="linknoteref-1432">1432</a>

      Another instance of kidnapping, accomplished by art rather than by force,
      is related to us by Homer.<a href="#linknote-1433" name="linknoteref-1433"       id="linknoteref-1433">1433</a> Eumæus, the swineherd of Ulysses, was the
      son of a king, dwelling towards the west, in an island off the Sicilian
      coast. A Phoenician woman, herself kidnapped from Sidon by piratical
      Taphians, had the task of nursing and tending him assigned to her, and
      discharged it faithfully until a great temptation befell her. A Sidonian
      merchant-ship visited the island, laden with rich store of precious wares,
      and proceeded to open a trade with the inhabitants, in the course of which
      one of the sailors seduced the Phoenician nurse, and suggested that when
      the vessel left, she should allow herself to be carried off in it. The
      woman, whose parents were still alive at Sidon, came into the scheme, and
      being apprised of the date of the ship&rsquo;s departure, stole away from the
      palace unobserved, taking with her three golden goblets, and also her
      master&rsquo;s child, the boy of whom she had charge. It was evening, and all
      having been prepared beforehand, the nurse and child were hastily smuggled
      on board, the sails were hoisted, and the ship was soon under weigh. The
      wretched woman died ere the voyage was over, but the boy survived, and was
      carried by the traders to Ithaca, and there sold for a good sum to
      Laërtes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not suggested that these narratives, in the form in which they have
      come down to us, are historically true. There may never have been an &ldquo;Io,
      daughter of Inachus,&rdquo; or an &ldquo;Eumæus, son of Ctesius Ormenides,&rdquo; or an
      island, &ldquo;Syria called by name, over against Ortygia,&rdquo; or even a Ulysses or
      a Laërtes. But the tales could never have grown up, have been invented, or
      have gained acceptance, unless the practice of kidnapping, on which they
      are based, had been known to be one in which the Phoenicians of the time
      indulged, at any rate occasionally. We must allow this blot on the
      Sidonian escutcheon, and can only plead, in extenuation of their offence,
      first, the imperfect morality of the age, and secondly, the fact that such
      deviations from the line of fair-dealing and honesty on the part of the
      Sidonian traders must have been of rare occurrence, or the flourishing and
      lucrative trade, which was the basis of all the glory and prosperity of
      the people, could not possibly have been established. Successful commerce
      must rest upon the foundation of mutual confidence; and mutual confidence
      is impossible unless the rules of fair dealing are observed on both sides,
      if not invariably, yet, at any rate, so generally that the infraction of
      them is not contemplated on either side as anything but the remotest
      contingency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the internal government of Sidon during this period no details have
      come down to us. Undoubtedly, like all the Phoenician cities in the early
      times,<a href="#linknote-1434" name="linknoteref-1434"       id="linknoteref-1434">1434</a> she had her own kings; and we may presume,
      from the almost universal practice in ancient times, and especially in the
      East,<a href="#linknote-1435" name="linknoteref-1435" id="linknoteref-1435">1435</a>
      that the monarchy was hereditary. The main duties of the king were to lead
      out the people to battle in time of war, and to administer justice in time
      of peace.<a href="#linknote-1436" name="linknoteref-1436"       id="linknoteref-1436">1436</a> The kings were in part supported, in part
      held in check, by a powerful aristocracy&mdash;an aristocracy which, we
      may conjecture, had wealth, rather than birth, as its basis. It does not
      appear that any political authority was possessed by the priesthood, nor
      that the priesthood was a caste, as in India, and (according to some
      writers) in Egypt. The priestly office was certainly not attached by any
      general custom to the person of the kings, though kings might be priests,
      and were so occasionally.<a href="#linknote-1437" name="linknoteref-1437"       id="linknoteref-1437">1437</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not distinctly hear of Sidon has having been engaged in any war
      during the period of her ascendancy, excepting that with the Philistines.
      Still as &ldquo;the Zidonians&rdquo; are mentioned among the nations which &ldquo;oppressed
      Israel&rdquo; in the time of the Judges,<a href="#linknote-1438"       name="linknoteref-1438" id="linknoteref-1438">1438</a> we must conclude
      that differences arose between them and their southern neighbours in some
      portion of this period, and that, war having broken out between them, the
      advantage rested with Sidon. The record of &ldquo;Judges&rdquo; is incomplete, and
      does not enable us even to fix the date of the Sidonian &ldquo;oppression.&rdquo; We
      can only say that it was anterior to the judgeship of Jephthah, and was
      followed, like the other &ldquo;oppressions,&rdquo; by a &ldquo;deliverance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The war with the Philistines brought the period of Sidonian ascendancy to
      an end, and introduces us to the second period of Phoenician history, or
      that of the hegemony of Tyre. The supposed date of the change is B.C.
      1252.<a href="#linknote-1439" name="linknoteref-1439" id="linknoteref-1439">1439</a>

    <p>
      Tyre was noted as a &ldquo;strong city&rdquo; as early as the time of Joshua,<a
      href="#linknote-1440" name="linknoteref-1440" id="linknoteref-1440">1440</a>
      and was probably inferior only to Sidon, or to Sidon and Aradus, during
      the period of Sidonian ascendancy. It is mentioned in the &ldquo;Travels of a
      Mohar&rdquo; (about B.C. 1350) as &ldquo;a port, richer in fish than in sands."<a
      href="#linknote-1441" name="linknoteref-1441" id="linknoteref-1441">1441</a>
      The tradition was, that it acquired its predominance and pre-eminence from
      the accession of the Sidonian population, which fled thither by sea, when
      no longer able to resist the forces of Ascalon.<a href="#linknote-1442"       name="linknoteref-1442" id="linknoteref-1442">1442</a> We do not find it,
      however, attaining to any great distinction or notoriety, until more than
      a century later, when it distinguishes itself by the colonisation of Gades
      (about B.C. 1130), beyond the Pillars of Hercules, on the shores of the
      Atlantic. We may perhaps deduce from this fact, that the concentration of
      energy caused by the removal to Tyre of the best elements in the
      population of Sidon gave a stimulus to enterprise, and caused longer
      voyages to be undertaken, and greater dangers to be affronted by the
      daring seamen of the Syrian coast than had ever been ventured on before.
      The Tyrian seamen were, perhaps, of a tougher fibre than the Sidonian, and
      the change of hegemony is certainly accompanied by a greater display of
      energy, a more adventurous spirit, a wider colonisation, and a more
      wonderful commercial success, than characterise the preceding period of
      Sidonian leadership and influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The settlements planted by Tyre in the first burst of her colonising
      energy seem to have been, besides Gades, Thasos, Abdera, and Pronectus
      towards the north, Malaca, Sexti, Carteia, Belon, and a second Abdera in
      Spain, together with Caralis in Sardinia,<a href="#linknote-1443"       name="linknoteref-1443" id="linknoteref-1443">1443</a> Tingis and Lixus on
      the West African coast, and in North Africa Hadrumetum and the lesser
      Leptis.<a href="#linknote-1444" name="linknoteref-1444"       id="linknoteref-1444">1444</a> Her aim was to throw the meshes of her
      commerce wider than Sidon had ever done, and so to sweep into her net a
      more abundant booty. It was Tyre which especially affected &ldquo;long voyages,"<a
      href="#linknote-1445" name="linknoteref-1445" id="linknoteref-1445">1445</a>
      and induced her colonists of Gades to explore the shores outside the
      Pillars of Hercules, northwards as far as Cornwall and the Scilly Isles,
      southwards to the Fortunate Islands, and north-eastwards into the Baltic.
      It is, no doubt, uncertain at what date these explorations were effected,
      and some of them may belong to the <i>later</i> hegemony of Tyre, ab. B.C.
      600; but the forward movement of the twelfth century seems to have been
      distinctly Tyrian, and to have been one of the results of the new position
      in which she was placed by the sudden collapse of her elder sister, Sidon.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to some,<a href="#linknote-1446" name="linknoteref-1446"       id="linknoteref-1446">1446</a> Tyre, during the early period of her
      supremacy, was under the government of <i>shôphetim</i>, or &ldquo;judges;&rdquo; but
      the general usage of the Phoenician cities makes against this supposition.
      Philo in his &ldquo;Origines of Phoenicia&rdquo; speaks constantly of kings,<a
      href="#linknote-1447" name="linknoteref-1447" id="linknoteref-1447">1447</a>
      but never of judges. We hear of a king, Abd-Baal, at Berytus<a
      href="#linknote-1448" name="linknoteref-1448" id="linknoteref-1448">1448</a>
      about B.C. 1300. Sidonian kings are mentioned in connection with the myth
      of Europa.<a href="#linknote-1449" name="linknoteref-1449"       id="linknoteref-1449">1449</a> The cities founded by the Phoenicians in
      Cyprus are always under monarchical rule.<a href="#linknote-1450"       name="linknoteref-1450" id="linknoteref-1450">1450</a> Tyre itself, when
      its history first presents itself to us in any detail, is governed by a
      king.<a href="#linknote-1451" name="linknoteref-1451" id="linknoteref-1451">1451</a>
      All that can be urged on the other side is, that we know of no Tyrian king
      by name until about B.C. 1050; and that, if there had been earlier kings,
      it might have been expected that some record of them would have come down
      to us. But to argue thus is to ignore the extreme scantiness and casual
      character of the notices which have reached us bearing upon the early
      Phoenician history. No writer has left us any continuous history of
      Phoenicia, even in the barest outline.<a href="#linknote-1452"       name="linknoteref-1452" id="linknoteref-1452">1452</a> Native monumental
      annals are entirely wanting. We depend for the early times upon the
      accident of Jewish monarchs having come into contact occasionally with
      Phoenician ones, and on Jewish writers having noted the occasions in
      Jewish histories. Scripture and Josephus alone furnish our materials for
      the period now under consideration, and the materials are scanty,
      fragmentary, and sadly wanting in completeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is towards the middle of the eleventh century B.C. that these materials
      become available. About the time when David was acclaimed as king by the
      tribe of Judah at Hebron, a Phoenician prince mounted the throne of Tyre,
      by name Abibalus, or Abi-Baal.<a href="#linknote-1453"       name="linknoteref-1453" id="linknoteref-1453">1453</a> We do not know the
      length of his reign; but, while the son of Jesse was still in the full
      vigour of life, Abi-Baal was succeeded on the Tyrian throne by his son,
      Hiram or Hirôm, a prince of great energy, of varied tastes, and of an
      unusually broad and liberal turn of mind. Hiram, casting his eye over the
      condition of the states and kingdoms which were his neighbours, seems to
      have discerned in Judah and David a power and a ruler whose friendship it
      was desirable to cultivate with a view to the establishment of very close
      relations. Accordingly, it was not long after the Jewish monarch&rsquo;s capture
      of the Jebusite stronghold on Mount Zion that the Tyrian prince sent
      messengers to him to Jerusalem, with a present of &ldquo;timber of cedars,&rdquo; and
      a number of carpenters, and stone-hewers, well skilled in the art of
      building.<a href="#linknote-1454" name="linknoteref-1454"       id="linknoteref-1454">1454</a> David accepted their services, and a goodly
      palace soon arose on some part of the Eastern hill, of which cedar from
      Lebanon was the chief material,<a href="#linknote-1455"       name="linknoteref-1455" id="linknoteref-1455">1455</a> and of which
      Hiram&rsquo;s workmen were the constructors. At a later date David set himself
      to collect abundant and choice materials for the magnificent Temple which
      Solomon his son was divinely commissioned to build on Mount Moriah to
      Jehovah; and here again &ldquo;the Zidonians and they of Tyre,&rdquo; or the subjects
      of Hiram, &ldquo;brought much cedar wood to David."<a href="#linknote-1456"       name="linknoteref-1456" id="linknoteref-1456">1456</a> The friendship
      continued firm to the close of David&rsquo;s reign;<a href="#linknote-1457"       name="linknoteref-1457" id="linknoteref-1457">1457</a> and when Solomon
      succeeded his father as king of Israel and lord of the whole tract between
      the middle Euphrates and Egypt, the bonds were drawn yet closer, and an
      alliance concluded which placed the two powers on terms of the very
      greatest intimacy. Hiram had no sooner heard of Solomon&rsquo;s accession than
      he sent an embassy to congratulate him;<a href="#linknote-1458"       name="linknoteref-1458" id="linknoteref-1458">1458</a> and Solomon took
      advantage of the opening which presented itself to announce his intention
      of building the Temple which his father had designed, and to request
      Hiram&rsquo;s aid in the completion of the work. Copies of letters which passed
      between the two monarchs were preserved both in the Tyrian and the Jewish
      archives, and the Tyrian versions are said to have been still extant in
      the public record office of the city in the first century of the Christian
      era.<a href="#linknote-1459" name="linknoteref-1459" id="linknoteref-1459">1459</a>
      These documents ran as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Solomon to King Hiram [sends greeting]:&mdash;Know that my father David
      was desirous of building a temple to God, but was prevented by his wars
      and his continual expeditions; for he did not rest from subduing his
      adversaries, until he had made every one of them tributary to him. And now
      I for my part return thanks to God for the present time of peace, and
      having rest thereby I purpose to build the house; for God declared to my
      father that it should be built by me. Wherefore I beseech thee to send
      some of thy servants with my servants to Mount Lebanon, to cut wood there,
      for none among us can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians. And I
      will pay the wood-cutters their hire at whatsoever rate thou shalt
      determine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;King Hiram to King Solomon [sends greeting]:&mdash;Needs must I praise
      God, that hath given thee to sit upon thy father&rsquo;s throne, seeing that
      thou art a wise man, and possessed of every virtue. And I, rejoicing at
      these things, will do all that thou hast desired of me. I will by my
      servants cut thee in abundance timber of cedar and timber of cypress, and
      will bring them down to the sea, and command my servants to construct of
      them a float, or raft, and navigate it to whatever point of thy coast thou
      mayest wish, and there discharge them; after which thy servants can carry
      them to Jerusalem. But be it thy care to provide me in return with a
      supply of food, whereof we are in want as inhabiting an island."<a
      href="#linknote-1460" name="linknoteref-1460" id="linknoteref-1460">1460</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The result was an arrangement by which the Tyrian monarch furnished his
      brother king with timber of various kinds, chiefly cedar, cut in Lebanon,
      and also with a certain number of trained artificers, workers in metal,
      carpenters, and masons, while the Israelite monarch on his part made a
      return in corn, wine, and oil, supplying Tyre, while the contract lasted,
      with 20,000 cors of wheat, the same quantity of barley, 20,000 baths of
      wine, and the same number of oil, annually.<a href="#linknote-1461"       name="linknoteref-1461" id="linknoteref-1461">1461</a> Phoenicia always
      needed to import supplies of food for its abundant population,<a
      href="#linknote-1462" name="linknoteref-1462" id="linknoteref-1462">1462</a>
      and having an inexhaustible store of timber in Lebanon, was glad to find a
      market for it so near. Thus the arrangement suited both parties. The
      hillsides of Galilee and the broad and fertile plains of Esdraelon and
      Sharon produced a superabundance of wheat and barley, whereof the
      inhabitants had to dispose in some quarter or other, and the highlands of
      Sumeria and Judæa bore oil and wine far beyond the wants of those who
      cultivated them. What Phoenicia lacked in these respects from the
      scantiness of its cultivable soil, Palestine was able and eager to supply;
      while to Phoenicia it was a boon to obtain, not only a market for her
      timber, but also employment for her surplus population, which under
      ordinary circumstances was always requiring to be carried off to distant
      lands, from the difficulty of supporting itself at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      A still greater advantage was it to the rude Judæans to get the assistance
      of their civilised and artistic neighbours in the design and execution,
      both of the Temple itself and of all those accessories, which in ancient
      times a sacred edifice on a large scale was regarded as requiring. The
      Phoenicians, and especially the Tyrians, had long possessed, both in their
      home and foreign settlements, temples of some pretension, and Hiram had
      recently been engaged in beautifying and adorning, perhaps in rebuilding,
      some of these venerable edifices at Tyre.<a href="#linknote-1463"       name="linknoteref-1463" id="linknoteref-1463">1463</a> A Phoenician
      architectural style had thus been formed, and Hiram&rsquo;s architects and
      artificers would be familiar with constructive principles and ornamental
      details, as well as with industrial processes, which are very unlikely to
      have been known at the time to the Hebrews. The wood for the Jewish Temple
      was roughly cut, and the stones quarried, by Israelite workmen;<a
      href="#linknote-1464" name="linknoteref-1464" id="linknoteref-1464">1464</a>
      but all the delicate work, whether in the one material or the other, was
      performed by the servants of Hiram. Stone-cutters from Gebal (Byblus)
      shaped and smoothed the &ldquo;great stones, costly stones&rdquo; employed in the
      substructions of the &ldquo;house;"<a href="#linknote-1465"       name="linknoteref-1465" id="linknoteref-1465">1465</a> Tyrian carpenters
      planed and polished the cedar planks used for the walls, and covered them
      with representations of cherubs and palms and gourds and opening flowers.<a
      href="#linknote-1466" name="linknoteref-1466" id="linknoteref-1466">1466</a>
      The metallurgists of Sidon probably supplied the cherubic figures in the
      inner sanctuary,<a href="#linknote-1467" name="linknoteref-1467"       id="linknoteref-1467">1467</a> as well as the castings for the doors,<a
      href="#linknote-1468" name="linknoteref-1468" id="linknoteref-1468">1468</a>
      and the bulk of the sacred vessels. The vail which separated between the
      &ldquo;Holy Place&rdquo; and the Holy of Holies&mdash;a marvellous fabric of blue, and
      purple, and crimson, and white, with cherubim wrought thereon<a
      href="#linknote-1469" name="linknoteref-1469" id="linknoteref-1469">1469</a>&mdash;owed
      its beauty probably to Tyrian dyers and Tyrian workers in embroidery. The
      master-workman lent by the Tyrian monarch to superintend the entire work&mdash;an
      extraordinary and almost universal genius&mdash;&ldquo;skilful to work in gold
      and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber; in purple, in
      blue, in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of graving"<a
      href="#linknote-1470" name="linknoteref-1470" id="linknoteref-1470">1470</a>&mdash;who
      bore the same name with the king,<a href="#linknote-1471"       name="linknoteref-1471" id="linknoteref-1471">1471</a> was the son of an
      Israelite mother, but boasted a Tyrian father,<a href="#linknote-1472"       name="linknoteref-1472" id="linknoteref-1472">1472</a> and was doubtless
      born and bred up at Tyre. Under his special direction were cast in the
      valley of the Jordan, between Succoth and Zarthan,<a href="#linknote-1473"       name="linknoteref-1473" id="linknoteref-1473">1473</a> those wonderful
      pillars, known as Jachin and Boaz, which have already been described, and
      which seem to have had their counterparts in the sacred edifices both of
      Phoenicia and Cyprus.<a href="#linknote-1474" name="linknoteref-1474"       id="linknoteref-1474">1474</a> To him also is specially ascribed the
      &ldquo;molten sea,&rdquo; standing on twelve oxen,<a href="#linknote-1475"       name="linknoteref-1475" id="linknoteref-1475">1475</a> which was perhaps
      the most artistic of all the objects placed within the Temple circuit, as
      are also the lavers upon wheels,<a href="#linknote-1476"       name="linknoteref-1476" id="linknoteref-1476">1476</a> which, if less
      striking as works of art, were even more curious.
    </p>
    <p>
      The partnership established between the two kingdoms in connection with
      the building and furnishing of the Jewish Temple, which lasted for seven
      years,<a href="#linknote-1477" name="linknoteref-1477"       id="linknoteref-1477">1477</a> was further continued for thirteen more<a
      href="#linknote-1478" name="linknoteref-1478" id="linknoteref-1478">1478</a>
      in connection with the construction of Solomon&rsquo;s palace. This palace, like
      an Assyrian one, consisted of several distinct edifices. &ldquo;The chief was a
      long hall which, like the Temple, was encased in cedar; whence probably
      its name, &lsquo;The House of the Forest of Lebanon.&rsquo; In front of it ran a
      pillared portico. Between this portico and the palace itself was a cedar
      porch, sometimes called the Tower of David. In this tower, apparently hung
      over the walls outside, were a thousand golden shields, which gave to the
      whole place the name of the Armoury. With a splendour that outshone any
      like fortress, the tower with these golden targets glittered far off in
      the sunshine like the tall neck, as it was thought, of a beautiful bride,
      decked out, after the manner of the East, with strings of golden coins.
      This porch was the gem and centre of the whole empire; and was so much
      thought of that a smaller likeness to it was erected in another part of
      the precinct for the queen. Within the porch itself was to be seen the
      king in state. On a throne of ivory, brought from Africa or India, the
      throne of many an Arabian legend, the kings of Judah were solemnly seated
      on the day of their accession. From its lofty seat, and under that high
      gateway, Solomon and his successors after him delivered their solemn
      judgments. That &lsquo;porch&rsquo; or &lsquo;gate of justice&rsquo; still kept alive the likeness
      of the old patriarchal custom of sitting in judgment at the gate; exactly
      as the &lsquo;Gate of Justice&rsquo; still recalls it to us at Granada, and the
      Sublime Porte&mdash;&lsquo;the Lofty Gate&rsquo;&mdash;at Constantinople. He sate on
      the back of a golden bull, its head turned over its shoulder, probably the
      ox or bull of Ephraim; under his feet, on each side of the steps, were six
      golden lions, probably the lions of Judah. This was &lsquo;the seat of
      Judgment.&rsquo; This was &lsquo;the throne of the House of David.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a
      href="#linknote-1479" name="linknoteref-1479" id="linknoteref-1479">1479</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      We have dwelt the longer upon these matters because it is from the lengthy
      and elaborate descriptions which the Hebrew writers give of these
      Phoenician constructions at Jerusalem that we must form our conceptions,
      not only of the state of Phoenician art in Hiram&rsquo;s time, but also of the
      works wherewith he adorned his own capital. He came to the throne at the
      age of nineteen,<a href="#linknote-1480" name="linknoteref-1480"       id="linknoteref-1480">1480</a> on the decease of his father, and
      immediately set to work to improve, enlarge, and beautify the city, which
      in his time claimed the headship of, at any rate, all Southern Phoenicia.
      He found Tyre a city built on two islands, separated the one from the
      other by a narrow channel, and so cramped for room that the inhabitants
      had no open square, or public place, on which they could meet, and were
      closely packed in overcrowded dwellings.<a href="#linknote-1481"       name="linknoteref-1481" id="linknoteref-1481">1481</a> The primary
      necessity was to increase the area of the place; and this Hiram effected,
      first, by filling up the channel between the two islands with stone and
      rubbish, and so gaining a space for new buildings, and then by
      constructing huge moles or embankments towards the east, and towards the
      south, where the sea was shallowest, and thus turning what had been water
      into land. In this way he so enlarged the town that he was able to lay out
      a &ldquo;wide space&rdquo; (Eurychôrus)<a href="#linknote-1482" name="linknoteref-1482"       id="linknoteref-1482">1482</a> as a public square, which, like the Piazza
      di San Marco at Venice, became the great resort of the inhabitants for
      business and pleasure. Having thus provided for utility and convenience,
      he next proceeded to embellishment and ornamentation. The old temples did
      not seem to him worthy of the renovated capital; he therefore pulled them
      down and built new ones in their place. In the most central part of the
      city<a href="#linknote-1483" name="linknoteref-1483" id="linknoteref-1483">1483</a>
      he erected a fane for the worship of Melkarth and Ashtoreth, probably
      retaining the old site, but constructing an entirely new building&mdash;the
      building which Herodotus visited,<a href="#linknote-1484"       name="linknoteref-1484" id="linknoteref-1484">1484</a> and in which
      Alexander insisted on sacrificing.<a href="#linknote-1485"       name="linknoteref-1485" id="linknoteref-1485">1485</a> Towards the
      south-west,<a href="#linknote-1486" name="linknoteref-1486"       id="linknoteref-1486">1486</a> on what had been a separate islet, he
      raised a temple to Baal, and adorned it with a lofty pillar of gold,<a
      href="#linknote-1487" name="linknoteref-1487" id="linknoteref-1487">1487</a>
      or at any rate plated with gold. Whether he built himself a new palace is
      not related; but as the royal residence of later times was situated on the
      southern shore,<a href="#linknote-1488" name="linknoteref-1488"       id="linknoteref-1488">1488</a> which was one of Hiram&rsquo;s additions to his
      capital, it is perhaps most probable that the construction of this new
      palace was due to him. The chief material which he used in his buildings
      was, as in Jerusalem, cedar. The substructions alone were of stone. They
      were probably not on so grand a scale as those of the Jewish Temple, since
      the wealth of Hiram, sovereign of a petty kingdom, must have fallen very
      far short of Solomon&rsquo;s, ruler of an extensive empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the close of the twenty years during which Hiram had assisted Solomon
      in his buildings, the Israelite monarch deemed it right to make his Tyrian
      brother some additional compensation beyond the corn, and wine, and oil
      with which, according to his contract, he had annually supplied him.
      Accordingly, he voluntarily ceded to him a district of Galilee containing
      twenty cities, a portion of the old inheritance of Asher,<a
      href="#linknote-1489" name="linknoteref-1489" id="linknoteref-1489">1489</a>
      conveniently near to Accho, of which Hiram was probably lord, and not very
      remote from Tyre. The tract appears to have been that where the modern
      Kabûl now stands, which is a rocky and bare highland,<a
      href="#linknote-1490" name="linknoteref-1490" id="linknoteref-1490">1490</a>&mdash;part
      of the outlying roots of Lebanon&mdash;overlooking the rich plain of Akka
      or Accho, and presenting a striking contrast to its fertility. Hiram, on
      the completion of the cession, &ldquo;came out from Tyre to see the cities which
      Solomon had given him,&rdquo; and was disappointed with the gift. &ldquo;What cities
      are these,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;which thou hast given me, my brother? And he called
      them the land of Cabul&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;rubbish&rdquo; or &ldquo;offscourings&rdquo;&mdash;to mark
      his disappointment.<a href="#linknote-1491" name="linknoteref-1491"       id="linknoteref-1491">1491</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      But this passing grievance was not allowed in any way to overshadow, or
      interfere with, the friendly alliance and &ldquo;entente cordiale&rdquo; (to use a
      modern phrase) which existed between the two nations. Solomon, according
      to one authority,<a href="#linknote-1492" name="linknoteref-1492"       id="linknoteref-1492">1492</a> paid a visit to Tyre, and gratified his
      host by worshipping in a Sidonian temple. According to another,<a
      href="#linknote-1493" name="linknoteref-1493" id="linknoteref-1493">1493</a>
      Hiram gave him in marriage, as a secondary wife, one of his own daughters&mdash;a
      marriage perhaps alluded to by the writer of Kings when he tells us that
      &ldquo;King Solomon loved many strange women together with the daughter of
      Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, <i>Zidonians</i>, and
      Hittites."<a href="#linknote-1494" name="linknoteref-1494"       id="linknoteref-1494">1494</a> The closest commercial relations were
      established between the two countries, and the hope of them was probably
      one of the strongest reasons which attracted both parties to the alliance.
      The Tyrians, on their part, possessed abundant ships; their sailors had
      full &ldquo;knowledge of the sea,"<a href="#linknote-1495"       name="linknoteref-1495" id="linknoteref-1495">1495</a> and the trade of
      the Mediterranean was almost wholly in their hands. Solomon, on his side,
      being master of the port of Ezion-Geber on the Red Sea, had access to the
      lucrative traffic with Eastern Africa, Arabia, and perhaps India, which
      had hitherto been confined to the Egyptians and the Arabs. He had also, by
      his land power, a command of the trade routes along the Coele-Syrian
      valley, by Aleppo, and by Tadmor, which enabled him effectually either to
      help or to hinder the Phoenician land traffic. Thus either side had
      something to gain from the other, and a close commercial union might be
      safely counted on to work for the mutual advantage of both. Such a union,
      therefore, took place. Hiram admitted Solomon to a participation in his
      western traffic; and the two kings maintained a conjoint &ldquo;navy of
      Tarshish,"<a href="#linknote-1496" name="linknoteref-1496"       id="linknoteref-1496">1496</a> which, trading with Spain and the West
      coast of Africa, brought to Phoenicia and Palestine &ldquo;once in three years&rdquo;
       many precious and rare commodities, the chief of them being &ldquo;gold, and
      silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.&rdquo; Spain would yield the gold and the
      silver, for the Tagus brought down gold,<a href="#linknote-1497"       name="linknoteref-1497" id="linknoteref-1497">1497</a> and the Spanish
      silver-mines were the richest in the world.<a href="#linknote-1498"       name="linknoteref-1498" id="linknoteref-1498">1498</a> Africa would
      furnish in abundance the ivory and the apes; for elephants were numerous
      in Mauritania,<a href="#linknote-1499" name="linknoteref-1499"       id="linknoteref-1499">1499</a> and on the west coast,<a
      href="#linknote-14100" name="linknoteref-14100" id="linknoteref-14100">14100</a>
      in ancient times; and the gorilla<a href="#linknote-14101"       name="linknoteref-14101" id="linknoteref-14101">14101</a> and the Barbary
      ape are well-known African products. Africa may also have produced the
      &ldquo;peacocks,&rdquo; if <i>tukkiyim</i> are really &ldquo;peacocks,&rdquo; though they are not
      found there at the present day. Or the <i>tukkiyim</i> may have been
      Guinea-fowl&mdash;a bird of the same class with the peacock.
    </p>
    <p>
      In return, Solomon opened to Hiram the route to the East by way of the Red
      Sea. Solomon, doubtless by the assistance of shipwrights furnished to him
      from Tyre, &ldquo;made a navy of ships at Ezion-Geber, which is beside Eloth, on
      the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom,"<a href="#linknote-14102"       name="linknoteref-14102" id="linknoteref-14102">14102</a> and the sailors
      of the two nations conjointly manned the ships, and performed the voyage
      to Ophir, whence they brought gold, and &ldquo;great plenty of almug-trees,&rdquo; and
      precious stones.<a href="#linknote-14103" name="linknoteref-14103"       id="linknoteref-14103">14103</a> The position of Ophir has been much
      disputed, but the balance of argument is in favour of the theory which
      places it in Arabia, on the south-eastern coast, a little outside the
      Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb.<a href="#linknote-14104" name="linknoteref-14104"       id="linknoteref-14104">14104</a> It is possible that the fleet did not
      confine itself to trade with Ophir, but, once launched on the Indian
      Ocean, proceeded along the Atlantic coast to the Persian Gulf and the
      peninsula of Hindustan. Or Ophir may have been an Arab emporium for the
      Indian trade, and the merchants of Syria may have found there the Indian
      commodities, and the Indian woods,<a href="#linknote-14105"       name="linknoteref-14105" id="linknoteref-14105">14105</a> which they seem
      to have brought back with them to their own country. A most lucrative
      traffic was certainly established by the united efforts of the two kings;
      and if the lion&rsquo;s share of the profit fell to Solomon and the Hebrews,<a
      href="#linknote-14106" name="linknoteref-14106" id="linknoteref-14106">14106</a>
      still the Phoenicians and Hiram must have participated to some
      considerable extent in the gains made, or the arrangement would not have
      continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is thought that Hiram was engaged in one war of some importance.
      Menander tells us, according to the present text of Josephus,<a
      href="#linknote-14107" name="linknoteref-14107" id="linknoteref-14107">14107</a>
      that the &ldquo;Tityi&rdquo; revolted from him, and refused any longer to pay him
      tribute, whereupon he made an expedition against them, and succeeded in
      compelling them to submit to his authority. As the &ldquo;Tityi&rdquo; are an unknown
      people, conjecture has been busy in suggesting other names,<a
      href="#linknote-14108" name="linknoteref-14108" id="linknoteref-14108">14108</a>
      and critics are now of the opinion that the original word used by Menander
      was not &ldquo;Tityi,&rdquo; but &ldquo;Itykæi.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Itykæi&rdquo; are the people of Utica: and,
      if this emendation be accepted,<a href="#linknote-14109"       name="linknoteref-14109" id="linknoteref-14109">14109</a> we must regard
      Hiram as having had to crush a most important and dangerous rebellion.
      Utica, previously to the foundation of Carthage, was by far the most
      important of all the mid-African colonies, and her successful revolt would
      probably have meant to Tyre the loss of the greater portion, if not the
      whole, of those valuable settlements. A rival to her power would have
      sprung up in the West, which would have crippled her commerce in that
      quarter, and checked her colonising energy. She would have suffered thus
      early more than she did four hundred years later by the great development
      of the power of Carthage; would have lost a large portion of her prestige;
      and have entered on the period of her decline when she had but lately
      obtained a commanding position. Hiram&rsquo;s energy diverted these evils: he
      did not choose that his kingdom should be dismembered, if he could anyhow
      help it; and, offering a firm and strenuous opposition to the revolt, he
      succeeded in crushing it, and maintaining the unity of the empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brilliant reign of Hiram, which covered the space of forty-three
      years, was not followed, like that of Solomon, by any immediate troubles,
      either foreign or domestic. He had given his people, either at home or
      abroad, constant employment; he had consulted their convenience in the
      enlargement of his capital; he had enriched them, and gratified their love
      of adventure, by his commercial enterprises; he had maintained their
      prestige by rivetting their yoke upon a subject state; he had probably
      pleased them by the temples and other public buildings with which he had
      adorned and beautified their city. Accordingly, he went down to the grave
      in peace; and not only so, but left his dynasty firmly established in
      power. His son, Baal-azar or Baleazar, who was thirty-six years of age,
      succeeded him, and held the throne for seven years, when he died a natural
      death.<a href="#linknote-14110" name="linknoteref-14110"       id="linknoteref-14110">14110</a> Abd-Ashtoreth (Abdastartus), the fourth
      monarch of the house, then ascended the throne, at the age of twenty, and
      reigned for nine years before any troubles broke out. Then, however, a
      time of disturbance supervened. Four of his foster-brothers conspired
      against Abd-Ashtoreth, and murdered him. The eldest of them seized the
      throne, and maintained himself upon it for twelve years, when Astartus,
      perhaps a son of Baal-azar, became king, and restored the line of Hiram.
      He, too, like his predecessor, reigned twelve years, when his brother,
      Aserymus, succeeded him. Aserymus, after ruling for nine years, was
      murdered by another brother, Pheles, who, in his turn, succumbed to a
      conspiracy headed by the High Priest, Eth-baal, or Ithobal.<a
      href="#linknote-14111" name="linknoteref-14111" id="linknoteref-14111">14111</a>
      Thus, while the period immediately following the death of Hiram was one of
      tranquillity, that which supervened on the death of Abd-Astartus, Hiram&rsquo;s
      grandson, was disturbed and unsettled. Three monarchs met with violent
      deaths within the space of thirty-four years, and the reigning house was,
      at least, thrice changed during the same interval.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length with Ithobal a more tranquil time was reached. Ithobal, or
      Eth-baal, was not only king, but also High Priest of Ashtoreth, and thus
      united the highest sacerdotal with the highest civil authority. He was a
      man of decision and energy, a worthy successor of Hiram, gifted like him
      with wide-reaching views, and ambitious of distinction. One of his first
      acts was to ally himself with Ahab, King of Israel, by giving him his
      daughter, Jezebel, in marriage,<a href="#linknote-14112"       name="linknoteref-14112" id="linknoteref-14112">14112</a> thus
      strengthening his land dominion, and renewing the old relations of
      friendship with the Hebrew people. Another act of vigour assigned to him
      is the foundation of Botrys, on the Syrian coast, north of Gebal, perhaps
      a defensive movement against Assyria.<a href="#linknote-14113"       name="linknoteref-14113" id="linknoteref-14113">14113</a> Still more
      enterprising was his renewal of the African colonisation by his foundation
      of Aüza in Numidia,<a href="#linknote-14114" name="linknoteref-14114"       id="linknoteref-14114">14114</a> which became a city of some importance.
      Ithobal&rsquo;s reign lasted, we are told, thirty-two years. He was sixty-eight
      years of age at his death, and was succeeded by his son, who is called
      Badezor, probably a corruption of Balezor, or Baal-azar<a
      href="#linknote-14115" name="linknoteref-14115" id="linknoteref-14115">14115</a>&mdash;the
      name given by Hiram to his son and successor. Of Badezor we know nothing,
      except that he reigned six years, and was succeeded by his son Matgen,
      perhaps Mattan,<a href="#linknote-14116" name="linknoteref-14116"       id="linknoteref-14116">14116</a> a youth of twenty-three.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Matgen, or Mattan, whichever be the true form of the name, the
      internal history of Tyre becomes interesting. It appears that two parties
      already existed in the state, one aristocratic, and the other popular.<a
      href="#linknote-14117" name="linknoteref-14117" id="linknoteref-14117">14117</a>
      Mattan, fearing the ascendancy of the popular party, married his daughter,
      Elisa, whom he intended for his successor, to her uncle and his own
      brother, Sicharbas, who was High Priest of Melkarth, and therefore
      possessed of considerable authority in his own person. Having effected
      this marriage, and nominated Elisa to succeed him, Mattan died at the
      early age of thirty-two, after a reign of only nine years.<a
      href="#linknote-14118" name="linknoteref-14118" id="linknoteref-14118">14118</a>
      Besides his daughter, he had left behind him a son, Pygmalion, who, at his
      decease, was but eight or nine years old. This child the democratic party
      contrived to get under their influence, proclaimed him king, young as he
      was, and placed him upon the throne. Elisa and her husband retired into
      private life, and lived in peace for seven years, but Pygmalion, being
      then grown to manhood, was not content to leave them any longer
      unmolested. He murdered Sicharbas, and endeavoured to seize his riches.
      But the ex-Queen contrived to frustrate his design, and having possessed
      herself of a fleet of ships, and taken on board the greater number of the
      nobles, sailed away, with her husband&rsquo;s wealth untouched, to Cyprus first,
      and then to Africa.<a href="#linknote-14119" name="linknoteref-14119"       id="linknoteref-14119">14119</a> Here, by agreement with the inhabitants,
      a site was obtained, and the famous settlement founded, which became known
      to the Greeks as &ldquo;Karchêdon,&rdquo; and to the Romans as &ldquo;Carthago,&rdquo; or
      Carthage. Josephus places this event in the hundred and forty-fourth year
      after the building of the Temple of Solomon,<a href="#linknote-14120"       name="linknoteref-14120" id="linknoteref-14120">14120</a> or about B.C.
      860. This date, however, is far from certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appears to have been in the reign of Ithobal that the first contact
      took place between Phoenicia and Assyria. About B.C. 885, a powerful and
      warlike monarch, by name Asshur-nazir-pal, mounted the throne of Nineveh,
      and shortly engaged in a series of wars towards the south, the east, the
      north, and the north-west.<a href="#linknote-14121"       name="linknoteref-14121" id="linknoteref-14121">14121</a> In the
      last-named direction he crossed the Euphrates at Carchemish (Jerablus),
      and, having overrun the country between that river and the Orontes, he
      proceeded to pass this latter stream also, and to carry his arms into the
      rich tract which lay between the Orontes and the Mediterranean. &ldquo;It was a
      tract,&rdquo; says M. Maspero,<a href="#linknote-14122" name="linknoteref-14122"       id="linknoteref-14122">14122</a> &ldquo;opulent and thickly populated, at once
      full of industries and commercial; the metals, both precious and ordinary,
      gold, silver, copper, tin (?), iron, were abundant; traffic with Phoenicia
      supplied it with the purple dye, and with linen stuffs, with ebony and
      with sandal-wood. Asshur-nazir-pal&rsquo;s attack seems to have surprised the
      chief of the Hittites in a time of profound peace. Sangar, King of
      Carchemish, allowed the passage of the Euphrates to take place without
      disputing it, and opened to the Assyrians the gates of his capital.
      Lubarna, king of Kunulua, alarmed at the power of the enemy, and dreading
      the issue of a battle, came to terms with him, consenting to make over to
      him twenty talents of gold, a talent of silver, two hundred talents of
      tin, a hundred of iron, 2,000 oxen, 10,000 sheep, a thousand garments of
      wool or linen, together with furniture, arms, and slaves beyond all count.
      The country of Lukhuti resisted, and suffered the natural consequences&mdash;all
      the cities were sacked, and the prisoners crucified. After this exploit,
      Asshur-nazir-pal occupied both the slopes of Mount Lebanon, and then
      descended to the shores of the Mediterranean. Phoenicia did not await his
      arrival to do him homage: the kings of Tyre, Sidon, Gebal, and Arvad,
      &lsquo;which is in the midst of the sea,&rsquo; sent him presents. The Assyrians
      employed their time in cutting down cedar trees in Lebanon and Amanus,
      together with pines and cypresses, which they transported to Nineveh to be
      used in the construction of a temple to Ishtar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The period of the Assyrian subjection, which commenced with this attack on
      the part of Asshur-nazir-pal, will be the subject of the next section. It
      only remains here briefly to recapitulate the salient points of Phoenician
      history under Tyre&rsquo;s first supremacy. In the first place, it was a time of
      increased daring and enterprise, in which colonies were planted upon the
      shores of the Atlantic Ocean, and trade extended to the remote south, the
      more remote north, and the still more remote north-east, to the Fortunate
      Islands, the Cassiterides, and probably the Baltic. Secondly, it was a
      time when the colonies on the North African coast were reinforced,
      strengthened, and increased in number; when the Phoenician yoke was
      rivetted on that vast projection into the Mediterranean which divides that
      sea into two halves, and goes far to give the power possessing it entire
      command of the Mediterranean waters. Thirdly, it was a time of extended
      commerce with the East, perhaps the only time when Phoenician merchant
      vessels were free to share in the trade of the Red Sea, to adventure
      themselves in the Indian Ocean, and to explore the distant coasts of
      Eastern Africa, Southern Arabia, Beloochistan, India and Ceylon. Fourthly,
      it was a time of artistic vigour and development, when Tyre herself
      assumed that aspect of splendour and magnificence which thenceforth
      characterised her until her destruction by Alexander, and when she so
      abounded in æsthetic energy and genius that she could afford to take the
      direction of an art movement in a neighbouring country, and to plant her
      ideas on that conspicuous hill which for more than a thousand years drew
      the eyes of men almost more than any other city of the East, and was only
      destroyed because she was felt by Rome to be a rival that she could not
      venture to spare. Finally, it was a time when internal dissensions, long
      existing, came to a head, and the state lost, through a sudden desertion,
      a considerable portion of its strength, which was transferred to a distant
      continent, and there steadily, if not rapidly, developed itself into a
      power, not antagonistic indeed, but still, by the necessity of its
      position, a rival power&mdash;a new commercial star, before which all
      other stars, whatever their brightness had been, paled and waned&mdash;a
      new factor in the polity of nations, whereof account had of necessity to
      be taken; a new trade-centre, which could not but supersede to a great
      extent all former trade-centres, and which, however unwillingly, as it
      rose, and advanced, and prospered, tended to dim, obscure, and eclipse the
      glories of its mother-city.

     Summary.
</pre>
    <p>
      The first contact of Phoenicia with Assyria took place, as above observed,
      in the reign of Asshur-nazir-pal, about the year B.C. 877. The principal
      cities, on the approach of the great conquering monarch, with his
      multitudinous array of chariots, his clouds of horse, and his innumerable
      host of foot soldiers, made haste to submit themselves, sought to
      propitiate the invader by rich gifts, and accepted what they hoped might
      prove a nominal subjection. Arvad, which, as the most northern, was the
      most directly threatened, Gebal, Sidon, and even the comparatively remote
      Tyre, sent their several embassies, made their offerings, and became, in
      name at any rate, Assyrian dependencies. But the real subjection of this
      country was not effected at this time, nor without a struggle.
      Asshur-nazir-pal&rsquo;s yoke lay lightly upon his vassals, and during the
      remainder of his long reign&mdash;from B.C. 877 to B.C. 860&mdash;he seems
      to have desisted from military expeditions,<a href="#linknote-14123"       name="linknoteref-14123" id="linknoteref-14123">14123</a> and to have
      exerted no pressure on the countries situated west of the Euphrates. It
      was not until the reign of his son and successor, Shalmaneser II., that
      the real conquest of Syria and Phoenicia was taken in hand, and pressed to
      a successful issue by a long series of hard-fought campaigns and bloody
      battles. From his sixth to his twenty-first year Shamaneser carried on an
      almost continuous war in Syria,<a href="#linknote-14124"       name="linknoteref-14124" id="linknoteref-14124">14124</a> where his
      adversaries were the monarchs of Damascus and Hamath, and &ldquo;the twelve
      kings beside the sea, above and below,"<a href="#linknote-14125"       name="linknoteref-14125" id="linknoteref-14125">14125</a> one of whom is
      expressly declared to have been &ldquo;Mattan-Baal of Arvad."<a
      href="#linknote-14126" name="linknoteref-14126" id="linknoteref-14126">14126</a>
      It was not until the year B.C. 839 that this struggle was terminated by
      the submission of the monarchs engaged in it to their great adversary, and
      the firm establishment of a system of &ldquo;tribute and taxes."<a
      href="#linknote-14127" name="linknoteref-14127" id="linknoteref-14127">14127</a>
      The Phoenician towns agreed to pay annually to the Assyrian monarch a
      certain fixed sum in the precious metals, and further to make him presents
      from time to time of the best products of their country. Among these are
      mentioned &ldquo;skins of buffaloes, horns of buffaloes, clothing of wool and
      linen, violet wool, purple wool, strong wood, wood for weapons, skins of
      sheep, fleeces of shining purple, and birds of heaven."<a
      href="#linknote-14128" name="linknoteref-14128" id="linknoteref-14128">14128</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The relations of Phoenicia towards the Assyrian monarchy continued to be
      absolutely peaceful for above a century. The cities retained their native
      monarchs, their laws and institutions, their religion, and their entire
      internal administration. So long as they paid the fixed tribute, they
      appear not to have been interfered with in any way. It would seem that
      their trade prospered. Assyria had under her control the greater portion
      of those commercial routes across the continent of Asia,<a
      href="#linknote-14129" name="linknoteref-14129" id="linknoteref-14129">14129</a>
      which it was of the highest importance to Phoenicia to have open and free
      from peril. Her caravans could traverse them with increased security, now
      that they were safeguarded by a power whereof she was a dependency. She
      may even have obtained through Assyria access to regions which had been
      previously closed to her, as Media, and perhaps Persia. At any rate Tyre
      seems to have been as flourishing in the later times of the Assyrian
      dominion as at almost any other period. Isaiah, in denouncing woe upon
      her, towards the close of the dominion, shows us what she had been under
      it:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Be silent (he says), ye inhabitants of the island,
     Which the merchants of Zidon, that pass over the sea, have

     The harvest of the River, has been her revenue:

     She was a joyful city,
     Her antiquity was of ancient days . . .
     She was a city that dispensed crowns;
     Her merchants were princes,
     And her traffickers the honourable of the earth.<a href="#linknote-14130"       name="linknoteref-14130" id="linknoteref-14130">14130</a>
</pre>
    <p>
      A change in the friendly feelings of the Phoenician cities towards Assyria
      first began after the rise of the Second or Lower Assyrian Empire, which
      was founded, about B.C. 745, by Tiglath-pileser II.<a
      href="#linknote-14131" name="linknoteref-14131" id="linknoteref-14131">14131</a>
      Tiglath-pileser, after a time of quiescence and decay, raised up Assyria
      to be once more a great conquering power, and energetically applied
      himself to the consolidation and unification of the empire. It was the
      Assyrian system, as it was the Roman, to absorb nations by slow degrees&mdash;to
      begin by offering protection and asking in return a moderate tribute; then
      to draw the bonds more close, to make fresh demands and enforce them;
      finally, to pick a quarrel, effect a conquest, and absorb the country,
      leaving it no vestige of independence. Tiglath-pileser began this process
      of absorption in Northern Syria about the year B.C. 740. He rearranged the
      population in the various towns, taking from some and giving to others,<a
      href="#linknote-14132" name="linknoteref-14132" id="linknoteref-14132">14132</a>
      adding also in most cases an Assyrian element, appointing Assyrian
      governors,<a href="#linknote-14133" name="linknoteref-14133"       id="linknoteref-14133">14133</a> and requiring of the inhabitants &ldquo;the
      performance of service like the Assyrians."<a href="#linknote-14134"       name="linknoteref-14134" id="linknoteref-14134">14134</a> Among the places
      thus treated between the years B.C. 740 and B.C. 738, we find the
      Phoenician cities of Zimirra, or Simyra, and Arqa, or Arka. Zimirra was in
      the plain between the sea and Mount Bargylus, not very far from the island
      of Aradus, whereof it was a dependency. Arqa was further to the south,
      beyond the Eleutherus, and belonged properly to Tripolis, if Tripolis had
      as yet been founded, or else to Botrys. Both of them were readily
      accessible from the Orontes valley along the course of the Eleutherus,
      and, being weak, could offer no resistance. Tiglath-pileser carried out
      his plans, rearranged the populations, and placed the cities under
      Assyrian governors responsible to himself. There was no immediate
      outbreak; but the injury rankled. Within twenty years Zimirra joined a
      revolt, to which Hamath, Arpad, Damascus, and Samaria were likewise
      parties, and made a desperate attempt to shake off the Assyrian yoke.<a
      href="#linknote-14135" name="linknoteref-14135" id="linknoteref-14135">14135</a>
      The attempt failed, the revolt was crushed, and Zimirra is heard of no
      more in history.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was not the worst. The harsh treatment of Simyra and Arka,
      without complaint made or offence given, after a full century of patient
      and quiet submission, aroused a feeling of alarm and indignation among the
      Phoenician cities generally, which could not fail to see in what had
      befallen their sisters a foreshadowing of the fate that they had to expect
      one day themselves. Beginning with the weakest cities, Assyria would
      naturally go on to absorb those which were stronger, and Tyre herself, the
      &ldquo;anointed cherub,"<a href="#linknote-14136" name="linknoteref-14136"       id="linknoteref-14136">14136</a> could look for no greater favour than,
      like Ulysses in the cave of Polyphemus, to be devoured last. Luliya, or
      Elulæus, the king of Tyre at the time,<a href="#linknote-14137"       name="linknoteref-14137" id="linknoteref-14137">14137</a> endeavoured to
      escape this calamity by gathering to himself a strength which would enable
      him to defy attack. He contrived to establish his dominion over almost the
      whole of Southern Phoenicia&mdash;over Sidon, Accho, Ecdippa, Sarepta,
      Hosah, Bitsette, Mahalliba, &amp;c.<a href="#linknote-14138"       name="linknoteref-14138" id="linknoteref-14138">14138</a>&mdash;and at the
      same time over the distant Cyprus,<a href="#linknote-14139"       name="linknoteref-14139" id="linknoteref-14139">14139</a> where the
      Cittæans, or people of Citium, held command of the island. After a time
      the Cittæans revolted from him, probably stirred up by the Assyrians. But
      Elulæus, without delay, led an expedition into Cyprus, and speedily put
      down the rebellion. Hereupon the Assyrian king of the time, Shalmaneser
      IV., the successor and probably the son of Tiglath-pileser II., led a
      great expedition into the west about B.C. 727, and &ldquo;overran all Syria and
      Phoenicia."<a href="#linknote-14140" name="linknoteref-14140"       id="linknoteref-14140">14140</a> But he was unable to make any
      considerable impression. Tyre and Aradus were safe upon their islands;
      Sidon and the other cities upon the mainland, were protected by strong and
      lofty walls. After a single campaign, the Great King found it necessary to
      offer terms of peace, which proved acceptable, and the belligerents parted
      towards the close of the year, without any serious loss or gain on either
      side.<a href="#linknote-14141" name="linknoteref-14141"       id="linknoteref-14141">14141</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed necessary to adopt some different course of action. Shalmaneser
      had discovered during his abortive campaign that there were discords and
      jealousies among the various Phoenician cities; that none of them
      submitted without repugnance to the authority of Tyre, and that Sidon
      especially had an ancient ground of quarrel with her more powerful sister,
      and always cherished the hope of recovering her original supremacy. He had
      seen also that the greater number of the Phoenician towns, if he chose to
      press upon them with the full force of his immense military organisation,
      lay at his mercy. He had only to invest each city on the land side, to
      occupy its territory, to burn its villas, to destroy its irrigation works,
      to cut down its fruit trees, to interfere with its water-supply, and in
      the last instance to press upon it, to batter down its walls, to enter its
      streets, slaughter its population, or drive it to take refuge in its
      ships,<a href="#linknote-14142" name="linknoteref-14142"       id="linknoteref-14142">14142</a> and he could become absolute master of
      the whole Phoenician mainland. Only Tyre and Aradus could escape him. But
      might not they also be brought into subjection by the naval forces which
      their sister cities, once occupied, might be compelled to furnish, and to
      man, or, at any rate, to assist in manning? Might not the whole of
      Phoenicia be in this way absorbed into the empire? The prospect was
      pleasing, and Shalmaneser set to work to convert the vision into a
      reality. By his emissaries he stirred up the spirit of disaffection among
      the Tyrian subject towns, and succeeded in separating from Tyre, and
      drawing over to his own side, not only Sidon and Acre and their
      dependencies, but even the city of Palæ-Tyrus itself,<a
      href="#linknote-14143" name="linknoteref-14143" id="linknoteref-14143">14143</a>
      or the great town which had grown up opposite the island Tyre upon the
      mainland. The island Tyre seems to have been left without support or ally,
      to fight her own battle singly. Shalmaneser called upon his new friends to
      furnish him with a fleet, and they readily responded to the call, placing
      their ships at his disposal to the number of sixty, and supplying him
      further with eight hundred skilled oarsmen, not a sufficient number to
      dispense with Assyrian aid, but enough to furnish a nucleus of able seamen
      for each vessel. The attack was then made. The Assyro-Phoenician fleet
      sailed in a body from some port on the continent, and made a demonstration
      against the Island City, which they may perhaps have expected to frighten
      into a surrender. But the Tyrians were in no way alarmed. They knew,
      probably, that their own countrymen would not fight with very much zeal
      for their foreign masters, and they despised, undoubtedly, the mixed
      crews, half skilled seamen, half tiros and bunglers, which had been
      brought against them. Accordingly they thought it sufficient to put to sea
      with just a dozen ships&mdash;one to each five of the enemy, and making a
      sudden attack with these upon the adverse fleet, they defeated it,
      dispersed it, and took five hundred prisoners. Shalmaneser saw that he had
      again miscalculated; and, despairing of any immediate success, drew off
      his ships and his troops, and retired to his own country. He left behind
      him, however, on the mainland opposite the island Tyre, a certain number
      of his soldiers, with orders to prevent the Tyrians from obtaining,
      according to their ordinary practice, supplies of water from the
      continent. Some were stationed at the mouth of the river Leontes (the
      Litany), a little to the north of Tyre, a perennial stream bringing down a
      large quantity of water from Coele-Syria and Lebanon; others held
      possession of the aqueducts on the south, built to convey the precious
      fluid across the plain from the copious springs of Ras el Ain<a
      href="#linknote-14144" name="linknoteref-14144" id="linknoteref-14144">14144</a>
      to the nearest point of the coast opposite the city. The continental water
      supply was thus effectually cut off; but the Tyrians were resolute, and
      made no overtures to the enemy. For five years, we are told,<a
      href="#linknote-14145" name="linknoteref-14145" id="linknoteref-14145">14145</a>
      they were content to drink such water only as could be obtained in their
      own island from wells sunk in the soil, which must have been brackish,
      unwholesome, and disagreeable. At the end of that time a revolution
      occurred at Nineveh. Shalmaneser lost his throne (B.C. 722), and a new
      dynasty succeeding, amid troubles of various kinds, attention was drawn
      away from Tyre to other quarters; and Elulæus was left in undisturbed
      possession of his island city for nearly a quarter of a century.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appears that, during this interval, Elulæus rebuilt the power which
      Shalmaneser had shattered and brought low, repossessing himself of Cyprus,
      or, at any rate, of some portion of it,<a href="#linknote-14146"       name="linknoteref-14146" id="linknoteref-14146">14146</a> and
      re-establishing his authority over all those cities of the mainland which
      had previously acknowledged subjection to him. These included Sidon,
      Bit-sette, Sarepta, Mahalliba, Hosah, Achzib or Ecdippa, and Accho (Acre).
      There is some ground for thinking that he transferred his own residence to
      Sidon,<a href="#linknote-14147" name="linknoteref-14147"       id="linknoteref-14147">14147</a> perhaps for the purpose of keeping closer
      watch upon the town which he most suspected of disaffection. The policy of
      Sargon seems to have been to leave Phoenicia alone, and content himself
      with drawing the tribute which the cities were quite willing to pay in
      return for Assyrian protection. His reign lasted from B.C. 722 to B.C.
      705, and it was not until Sennacherib, his son and successor, had been
      seated for four years upon the throne that a reversal of this policy took
      place, and war <i>à outrance</i> was declared against the Phoenician king,
      who had ventured to brave, and had succeeded in baffling, Assyria more
      than twenty years previously. Sennacherib entertained grand designs of
      conquest in this quarter, and could not allow the example of an unpunished
      and triumphant rebellion to be flaunted in the eyes of a dozen other
      subject states, tempting them to throw off their allegiance. He therefore,
      as soon as affairs in Babylonia ceased to occupy him, marched the full
      force of the empire towards the west, and proclaimed his intention of
      crushing the Phoenician revolt, and punishing the audacious rebel who had
      so long defied the might of Assyria. The army which he set in motion must

      Such terror did it inspire among those against whom it was directed that
      Elulæus was afraid even to await attack, and, while Sennacherib was still
      on his march, took ship and removed himself to the distant island of
      Cyprus,<a href="#linknote-14151" name="linknoteref-14151"       id="linknoteref-14151">14151</a> where alone he could feel safe from
      pursuit and capture. But, though deserted by their sovereign, his towns
      seem to have declined to submit themselves. No great battle was fought;
      but severally they took arms and defended their walls. Sennacherib tells
      us that he took one after another&mdash;&ldquo;by the might of the soldiers of
      Asshur his lord"<a href="#linknote-14152" name="linknoteref-14152"       id="linknoteref-14152">14152</a>&mdash;Great Sidon, Lesser Sidon,
      Bit-sette, Zarephath or Sarepta, Mahalliba, Hosah, Achzib or Ecdippa, and
      Accho&mdash;&ldquo;strong cities, fortresses, walled and enclosed, Luliya&rsquo;s
      castles."<a href="#linknote-14153" name="linknoteref-14153"       id="linknoteref-14153">14153</a> He does not claim, however, to have taken
      Tyre, and we may conclude that the Island City escaped him. But he made
      himself master of the entire tract upon the continent which had
      constituted Luliya&rsquo;s kingdom, and secured its obedience by placing over it
      a new king, in whom he had confidence, a certain Tubaal<a
      href="#linknote-14154" name="linknoteref-14154" id="linknoteref-14154">14154</a>
      (Tob-Baal), probably a Phoenician. At the same time he rearranged the
      yearly tribute which the cities had to pay to Assyria,<a
      href="#linknote-14155" name="linknoteref-14155" id="linknoteref-14155">14155</a>
      probably augmenting it, as a punishment for the long rebellion.
    </p>
    <p>
      We hear nothing more of Phoenicia during the reign of Sennacherib, except
      that, shortly after his conquest of the tract about Sidon, he received
      tribute, not only from the king whom he had just set over that town, but
      also from Uru-melek, king of Gebal (Byblus), and Abd-ilihit, king of
      Arvad.<a href="#linknote-14156" name="linknoteref-14156"       id="linknoteref-14156">14156</a> The three towns represent, probably, the
      whole of Phoenicia, Aradus at this time exercising dominion over the
      northern tract, or that extending from Mount Casius to the Eleutherus,
      Gebal or Byblus over the central tract from the Eleutherus to the Tamyras,
      and Sidon, in the temporary eclipse of Tyre, ruling the southern tract
      from the Tamyrus to Mount Carmel. It appears further,<a
      href="#linknote-14157" name="linknoteref-14157" id="linknoteref-14157">14157</a>
      that at some date between this tribute-giving (B.C. 701) and the death of
      Sennacherib (B.C. 681) Tubaal must have been succeeded in the government
      of Sidon by Abdi-Milkut, or Abd-Melkarth<a href="#linknote-14158"       name="linknoteref-14158" id="linknoteref-14158">14158</a> ({...}), but
      whether this change was caused by a revolt, or took place in the ordinary
      course, Tubaal dying and being succeeded by his son, is wholly uncertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that we know is that Esarhaddon, on his accession, found Abd-Melkarth
      in revolt against his authority. He had formed an alliance with a certain
      Sanduarri, king of Kundi and Sizu,<a href="#linknote-14159"       name="linknoteref-14159" id="linknoteref-14159">14159</a> a prince of the
      Lebanon, and had set up as independent monarch, probably during the time
      of the civil way which was waged between Esarhaddon and two of his
      brothers who disputed his succession after they had murdered his father.<a
      href="#linknote-14160" name="linknoteref-14160" id="linknoteref-14160">14160</a>
      As soon as this struggle was over, and the Assyrian monarch found himself
      free to take his own course, he proceeded at once (B.C. 680) against these
      two rebels. Both of them tried to escape him. Abd-Melkarth, quitting his
      capital, fled away by sea, steering probably either for Aradus or for
      Cyprus. Sanduarri took refuge in his mountain fastnesses. But Esarhaddon
      was not to be baffled. He caused both chiefs to be pursued and taken.
      &ldquo;Abd-Melkarth,&rdquo; he says,<a href="#linknote-14161" name="linknoteref-14161"       id="linknoteref-14161">14161</a> &ldquo;who from the face of my solders into the
      middle of the sea had fled, like a fish from out of the sea, I caught, and
      cut off his head . . . Sanduarri, who took Abd-Melkarth for his ally, and
      to his difficult mountains trusted, like a bird from the midst of the
      mountains, I caught and cut off his head.&rdquo; Sidon was very severely
      punished. Esarhaddon boasts that he swept away all its subject cities,
      uprooted its citadel and palace, and cast the materials into the sea, at
      the same time destroying all its habitations. The town was plundered, the
      treasures of the palace carried off, and the greater portion of the
      population deported to Assyria. The blank was filled up with &ldquo;natives of
      the lands and seas of the East&rdquo;&mdash;prisoners taken in Esarhaddon&rsquo;s war
      with Babylon and Elam, who, like the Phoenicians themselves at a remote
      time, exchanged a residence on the shores of the Persian Gulf for one on
      the distant Mediterranean. An Assyrian general was placed as governor over
      the city, and its name changed from Sidon to &ldquo;Ir-Esarhaddon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seems to have been in the course of the same year that Esarhaddon held
      one of those courts, or <i>durbars</i>, in Syria, which all subject
      monarchs were expected to attend, and whereat it was the custom that they
      should pay homage to their suzerain. Hither flocked almost all the
      neighbouring monarchs<a href="#linknote-14162" name="linknoteref-14162"       id="linknoteref-14162">14162</a>&mdash;Manasseh, king of Judah,
      Qavus-gabri, king of Ammon, Zilli-bel, king of Gaza, Mitinti of Askelon,
      Ikasamsu of Ekron, Ahimelek of Ashdod, together with twelve kings of the
      Cyprians, and three Phoenician monarchs, Baal, king of Tyre, Milki-asaph,
      king of Gebal, and Mattan-baal, king of Arvad. Tribute was paid, home
      rendered, and after a short sojourn at the court, the subject-monarchs
      were dismissed. The foremost position in Esarhaddon&rsquo;s list is occupied by
      &ldquo;Baal, king of Tyre;&rdquo; and this monarch appears to have been received into
      exceptional favour. He had perhaps been selected by Esarhaddon to rule
      Southern Phoenicia on the execution of Abd-Melkarth. At any rate, he
      enjoyed for some time the absolute confidence and high esteem of his
      suzerain. If we may venture to interpret a mutilated inscription,<a
      href="#linknote-14163" name="linknoteref-14163" id="linknoteref-14163">14163</a>
      he furnished Esarhaddon with a fleet, and manned it with his own sailors.
      Certainly, he received from Esarhaddon a considerable extension of his
      dominions. Not only was his authority over Accho recognised and affirmed,
      but the coast tract south of Carmel, as far as Dor, the important city
      Gebal, and the entire region of Lebanon, were placed under his
      sovereignty.<a href="#linknote-14164" name="linknoteref-14164"       id="linknoteref-14164">14164</a> The date assigned to these events is
      between B.C. 680 and B.C. 673. It was in this latter year that the
      Assyrian monarch resolved on an invasion of Egypt. For fifty years the two
      countries had been watching each other, counteracting each other&rsquo;s policy,
      lending support to each other&rsquo;s enemies, coming into occasional collision
      the one with the other, not, however, as principals, but as partakers in
      other persons&rsquo; quarrels. Now, at length there was to be an end of
      subterfuge and pretences. Esarhaddon, about B.C. 673, resolved to attempt
      the conquest of Egypt. He &ldquo;set his face to go to the country of Magan and
      Milukha."<a href="#linknote-14165" name="linknoteref-14165"       id="linknoteref-14165">14165</a> He let his intention be generally known.
      No doubt he called on his subject allies for contingents of men, if not
      for supplies of money. To Tyre he must naturally have looked for no
      niggard or grudging support. What then must have been his disgust and rage
      at finding that, at the critical moment, Tyre had gone over to the enemy?
      Notwithstanding the favours heaped on him by his suzerain, &ldquo;Baal, king of
      Tyre, to Tirhakah, king of Ethiopia, his country entrusted, and the yoke
      of Asshur threw off and made defiance."<a href="#linknote-14166"       name="linknoteref-14166" id="linknoteref-14166">14166</a> Esarhaddon was
      too strongly bent on his Egyptian expedition to be diverted from it by
      this defection; but in the year B.C. 672, as he marched through Syria and
      Palestine on his way to attack Tirhakah, he sent a detachment against
      Tyre, with orders to his officers to repeat the tactics of Shalmaneser, by
      occupying points of the coast opposite to the island Tyre, and &ldquo;cutting
      off the supplies of food and water."<a href="#linknote-14167"       name="linknoteref-14167" id="linknoteref-14167">14167</a> Baal was by this
      means greatly distressed, and it would seem that within a year or two he
      made his submission, surrendering either to Esarhaddon or to his son
      Asshur-bani-pal, in about the year of the latter&rsquo;s accession (B.C. 668).
      It is surprising to find that he was not deposed from his throne; but as
      the circumstances seem to have been such as made it imperative on the
      Assyrian king to condone minor offences in order to accomplish a great
      enterprise&mdash;the restoration of the Assyrian dominion over the Nile
      valley. Esarhaddon had effected the conquest of Egypt in about the year
      B.C. 670, and had divided the country into twenty petty principalities;<a
      href="#linknote-14168" name="linknoteref-14168" id="linknoteref-14168">14168</a>
      but within a year his yoke had been thrown off, his petty princes
      expelled, and Tirhakah reinstated as sole monarch over the &ldquo;Two Regions."<a
      href="#linknote-14169" name="linknoteref-14169" id="linknoteref-14169">14169</a>
      It was the determination of Asshur-bani-pal, on becoming king, to strain
      every nerve and devote his utmost energy to the re-conquest of the ancient
      kingdom, so lightly won and so lightly lost by his father. Baal&rsquo;s perfidy
      was thus forgiven or overlooked. A great expedition was prepared. The
      kings of Phoenicia, Palestine, and Cyprus were bidden once more to
      assemble, to bring their tribute, and pay homage to their suzerain as he
      passed on his way at the head of his forces towards the land of the
      Pharaohs. Baal came, and again holds the post of honour;<a
      href="#linknote-14170" name="linknoteref-14170" id="linknoteref-14170">14170</a>
      with him were the king of Judah&mdash;doubtless Manasseh, but the name is
      lost&mdash;the kings of Edom, Moab, Gaza, Askelon, Ekron, Gebal, Arvad,
      Paphos, Soli, Curium, Tamassus, Ammochosta, Lidini, and Aphrodisias, with
      probably those also of Ammon, Ashdod, Idalium, Citium, and Salamis.<a
      href="#linknote-14171" name="linknoteref-14171" id="linknoteref-14171">14171</a>
      Each in turn prostrated himself at the foot of the Great Monarch, paid
      homage, and made profession of fidelity. Asshur-bani-pal then proceeded on
      his way, and the kings returned to their several governments.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is about four years after this, B.C. 664, that we find Baal attacked
      and punished by the Assyrian monarch. The subjugation of Egypt had been in
      the meantime, though not without difficulty, completed. Asshur-bani-pal&rsquo;s
      power extended from the range of Niphates to the First Cataract. Whether
      during the course of the four years&rsquo; struggle, by which the reconquest of
      Egypt was effected, the Tyrian prince had given fresh offence to his
      suzerain, or whether it was the old offence, condoned for a time but never
      forgiven, that was now avenged, is not made clear by the Assyrian
      Inscriptions. Asshur-bani-pal simply tells us that, in his third
      expedition, he proceeded against Baal, king of Tyre, dwelling in the midst
      of the sea, <i>who his royal will disregarded, and did not listen to the
      words of his lips</i>. &ldquo;Towers round him,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I raised, and over
      his people I strengthened the watch; on sea and land his forts I took; his
      going out I stopped. Water and sea-water, to preserve their lives, their
      mouths drank. By a strong blockade, which removed not, I besieged them;
      their works I checked and opposed; to my yoke I made them submissive. The
      daughter proceeding from his body, and the daughters of his brothers, for
      concubines he brought to my presence. Yahi-milki, his son, the glory of
      the country, of unsurpassed renown, at once he sent forward, to make
      obeisance to me. His daughter, and the daughters of his brothers, with
      their great dowries, I received. Favour I granted him, and the son
      proceeding from his body, I restored, and gave him back."<a
      href="#linknote-14172" name="linknoteref-14172" id="linknoteref-14172">14172</a>
      Thus Baal once more escaped the fate he must have expected.
      Asshur-bani-pal, who was far from being of a clement disposition, suffered
      himself to be appeased by the submission made, restored Baal to his
      favour, and allowed him to retain possession of his sovereignty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another Phoenician monarch also was, about the same time, threatened and
      pardoned. This was Yakinlu, the king of Arvad, probably the son and
      successor of Mattan-Baal, the contemporary of Esarhaddon.<a
      href="#linknote-14173" name="linknoteref-14173" id="linknoteref-14173">14173</a>
      He is accused of having been wanting in submission to Asshur-bani-pal&rsquo;s
      fathers;<a href="#linknote-14174" name="linknoteref-14174"       id="linknoteref-14174">14174</a> but we may regard it as probable that his
      real offence was some failure in his duties towards Asshur-bani-pal
      himself. Either he had openly rebelled, and declared himself independent,
      or he had neglected to pay his tribute, or he had given recent offence in
      some other way. The Phoenician island kings were always more neglectful of
      their duties than others, since it was more difficult to punish them.
      Assyria did not even now possess any regular fleet, and could only punish
      a recalcitrant king of Arvad or Tyre by impressing into her service the
      ships of some of the Phoenician coast-towns, as Sidon, or Gebal, or Accho.
      These towns were not very zealous in such a service, and probably did not
      maintain strong navies, having little use for them. Thus Yakinlu may have
      expected that his neglect, whatever it was, would be overlooked. But
      Asshur-bani-pal was jealous of his rights, and careful not to allow any of
      them to lapse by disuse. He let his displeasure be known at the court of
      Yakinlu, and very shortly received an embassy of submission. Like Baal,
      Yakinlu sent a daughter to take her place among the great king&rsquo;s secondary
      wives, and with her he sent a large sum of money, in the disguise of a
      dowry.<a href="#linknote-14175" name="linknoteref-14175"       id="linknoteref-14175">14175</a> The tokens of subjection were accepted,
      and Yakinlu was allowed to continue king of Arvad. When, not long
      afterwards, he died,<a href="#linknote-14176" name="linknoteref-14176"       id="linknoteref-14176">14176</a> and his ten sons sought the court of
      Nineveh to prefer their claims to the succession, they were received with
      favour. Azi-Baal, the eldest, was appointed to the vacant kingdom, while
      his nine brothers were presented by Asshur-bani-pal with &ldquo;costly clothing,
      and rings."<a href="#linknote-14177" name="linknoteref-14177"       id="linknoteref-14177">14177</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Two other revolts of two other Phoenician towns belong to a somewhat later
      period. On his return from an expedition against Arabia, about B.C. 645,
      Asshur-bani-pal found that Hosah, a small place in the vicinity of Tyre,<a
      href="#linknote-14178" name="linknoteref-14178" id="linknoteref-14178">14178</a>
      and Accho, famous as Acre in later times, had risen in revolt against
      their Assyrian governors, refused their tribute, and asserted
      independence.<a href="#linknote-14179" name="linknoteref-14179"       id="linknoteref-14179">14179</a> He at once besieged, and soon captured,
      Hosah. The leaders of the rebellion he put to death; the plunder of the
      town, including the images of its gods, and the bulk of its population, he
      carried off into Assyria. The people of Accho, he says, he &ldquo;quieted.&rdquo; It
      is a common practice of conquerors &ldquo;to make a solitude and call it peace.&rdquo;
       Asshur-bani-pal appears to have punished Accho, first by a wholesale
      massacre, and then by the deportation of all its remaining inhabitants.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is evident from this continual series of revolts and rebellions that,
      however mild had been the sway of Assyria over her Phoenician subjects in
      the earlier times, it had by degrees become a hateful and a grinding
      tyranny. Commercial states, bent upon the accumulation of wealth, do not
      without grave cause take up arms and affront the perils of war, much less
      do so when their common sense must tell them that success is almost
      absolutely hopeless, and that failure will bring about their destruction.
      The Assyrians were a hard race. Such tenderness as they ever showed to any
      subject people was, we may be sure, in every case dictated by policy.
      While their power was unsettled, while they feared revolts, and were
      uncertain as to their consequences, their attitude towards their
      dependents was conciliating. When they became fully conscious of the
      immense preponderance of power which they wielded, and of the inability of
      the petty states of Asia to combine against them in any firm league, they
      grew careless and confident, reckless of giving offence, ruder in their
      behaviour, more grasping in their exactions, more domineering, more
      oppressive. Prudence should perhaps have counselled the Phoenician cities
      to submit, to be yielding and pliant, to cultivate the arts of the
      parasite and the flatterer; but the people had still a rough honesty about
      them. It was against the grain to flatter or submit themselves; constant
      voyages over wild seas in fragile vessels kept up their manhood; constant
      encounters with pirates, cannibals, and the rudest possible savages made
      them brave and daring; exposure to storm, and cold, and heat braced their
      frames; the nautical life developed and intensified in them a love of
      freedom. The Phoenician of Assyrian times was not to be coaxed into
      accepting patiently the lot of a slave. Suffer as he might by his revolts,
      they won him a certain respect; it is likely that they warded off many an
      indignity, many an outrage. The Assyrians knew that his endurance could
      not be reckoned on beyond a certain point, and they knew that in his
      death-throes he was dangerous. The Phoenicians probably suffered
      considerably less than the other subject nations under Assyrian rule; and
      the maritime population, which was the salt of the people, suffered least
      of all, since it was scarcely ever brought into contact with its nominal
      rulers.

      It is impossible to fix the year in which Phoenicia became independent of
      Assyria. The last trace of Assyrian interference, in the way of
      compulsion, with any of the towns belongs to B.C. 645, when she severely
      punished Hosah and Accho. The latest sign of her continued domination is
      found in B.C. 636, when the Assyrian governor of a Phoenician town,
      Zimirra, appears in the list of Eponyms.<a href="#linknote-14180"       name="linknoteref-14180" id="linknoteref-14180">14180</a> It must have
      been very soon after this that the empire became involved in those
      troubles and difficulties which led on to its dissolution. According to
      Herodotus,<a href="#linknote-14181" name="linknoteref-14181"       id="linknoteref-14181">14181</a> Cyaxares, king of Media, laid siege to
      Nineveh in B.C. 633, or very soon afterwards. His attack did not at once
      succeed; but it was almost immediately followed by the irruption into
      South-western Asia of Scythic hordes from beyond the Caucasus, which
      overran country after country, destroying and ravaging at their pleasure.<a
      href="#linknote-14182" name="linknoteref-14182" id="linknoteref-14182">14182</a>
      The reality of this invasion is now generally admitted. &ldquo;It was the
      earliest recorded,&rdquo; says a modern historian, &ldquo;of those movements of the
      northern populations, hid behind the long mountain barrier, which, under
      the name of Himalaya, Caucasus, Taurus, Hæmus, and the Alps, has been
      reared by nature between the civilised and uncivilised races of the old
      world. Suddenly, above this boundary, appeared those strange, uncouth,
      fur-clad forms, hardly to be distinguished from their horses and their
      waggons, fierce as their own wolves or bears, sweeping towards the
      southern regions, which seemed to them their natural prey. The successive
      invasions of Parthians, Turks, Mongols in Asia, of Gauls, Goths, Vandals,
      Huns in Europe, have, it is well said, &lsquo;illustrated the law, and made us
      familiar with its operations. But there was a time in history before it
      had come into force, and when its very existence must have been
      unsuspected. Even since it began to operate, it has so often undergone
      prolonged suspension that the wisest may be excused if they cease to bear
      it in mind, and are as much startled when a fresh illustration of it
      occurs, as if the like had never happened before.&lsquo;<a href="#linknote-14183"       name="linknoteref-14183" id="linknoteref-14183">14183</a> No wonder that
      now, when the veil was for the first time rent asunder, all the ancient
      monarchies of the South&mdash;Assyria, Babylon, Media, Egypt, even Greece
      and Asia Minor&mdash;stood aghast at the spectacle of these savage hordes
      rushing down on the seats of luxury and power."<a href="#linknote-14184"       name="linknoteref-14184" id="linknoteref-14184">14184</a> Assyria seems to
      have suffered from the attack almost as much as any other country. The
      hordes probably swarmed down from Media through the Zagros passes into the
      most fruitful portion of the empire&mdash;the flat country between the
      mountains and the Tigris. Many of the old cities, rich with the
      accumulated stores of ages, were besieged, and perhaps taken, and their
      palaces wantonly burnt by the barbarous invaders. The tide then swept on.
      Wandering from district to district, plundering everywhere, settling
      nowhere, the clouds of horse passed over Mesopotamia, the force of the
      invasion becoming weaker as it spread itself, until in Syria it reached
      its term through the policy of the Egyptian king, Psamatik I. That monarch
      bribed the nomads to advance no further,<a href="#linknote-14185"       name="linknoteref-14185" id="linknoteref-14185">14185</a> and from this
      time their power began to wane. Their numbers must have been greatly
      thinned in the long course of battles, sieges, and skirmishes wherein they
      were engaged year after year; they suffered also through their excesses;<a
      href="#linknote-14186" name="linknoteref-14186" id="linknoteref-14186">14186</a>
      and perhaps through intestine dissensions. At last they recognised that
      their power was broken. Many bands probably returned across the Caucasus
      into the Steppe country. Others submitted and took service under the
      native rulers of Asia.<a href="#linknote-14187" name="linknoteref-14187"       id="linknoteref-14187">14187</a> Great numbers were slain, and, except in
      a province of Armenia, which thenceforward became known as Sacasêné,<a
      href="#linknote-14188" name="linknoteref-14188" id="linknoteref-14188">14188</a>
      and perhaps in one Syrian town, which acquired the name of Scythopolis,<a
      href="#linknote-14189" name="linknoteref-14189" id="linknoteref-14189">14189</a>
      the invaders left no permanent trace of their brief but terrible inroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shock of the Scythian irruption cannot but have greatly injured and
      weakened Assyria. The whole country had been ravaged and depopulated; the
      provinces had been plundered, many of the towns had been taken and sacked,
      the palaces of the old kings had been burnt,<a href="#linknote-14190"       name="linknoteref-14190" id="linknoteref-14190">14190</a> and all the
      riches that had not been hid away had been lost. Assyria, when the
      Scythian wave had passed, was but the shadow of her former self. Her <i>prestige</i>
      was gone, her armed force must have been greatly diminished, her hold upon
      the provinces, especially the more distant ones, greatly weakened.
      Phoenicia is likely to have detached herself from Assyria at latest during
      the time that the Scyths were dominant, which was probably from about B.C.
      630 to B.C. 610. When Assyrian protection was withdrawn from Syria, as it
      must have been during this period, and when every state and town had to
      look solely to itself for deliverance from a barbarous and cruel enemy,
      the fiction of a nominal dependence on a distant power could scarcely be
      maintained. Without any actual revolt, the Phoenician cities became their
      own masters, and the speedy fall of Assyria before the combined attack of
      the Medes and Babylonians,<a href="#linknote-14191"       name="linknoteref-14191" id="linknoteref-14191">14191</a> after the
      Scythians had withdrawn, prevented for some time any interference with
      their recovered independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      A double danger, however, impended. On the one side Egypt, on the other
      Babylon, might be confidently expected to lay claim to the debatable land
      which nature had placed between the seats of the great Asiatic and the
      great African power, and which in the past had almost always been
      possessed by the one or the other of them. Egypt was the nearer of the
      two, and probably seemed the most to be feared. She had recently fallen
      under the power of an enterprising native monarch, who had already, before
      the fall of Assyria, shown that he entertained ambitious designs against
      the Palestinian towns, having begun attacks upon Ashdod soon after he
      ascended the throne.<a href="#linknote-14192" name="linknoteref-14192"       id="linknoteref-14192">14192</a> Babylon was, comparatively speaking,
      remote and had troublesome neighbours, who might be expected to prevent
      her from undertaking distant expeditions. It was clearly the true policy
      for Phoenicia to temporise, to enter into no engagements with either
      Babylon or Egypt, to strengthen her defences, to bide her time, and, so
      far as possible, to consolidate herself. Something like a desire for
      consolidation would seem to have come over the people; and Tyre, the
      leading city in all but the earliest times, appears to have been
      recognised as the centre towards which other states must gravitate, and to
      have risen to the occasion. If there ever was such a thing as a
      confederation of all the Phoenician cities, it would seem to have been at
      this period. Sidon forgot her ancient rivalry, and consented to furnish
      the Tyrian fleet with mariners.<a href="#linknote-14193"       name="linknoteref-14193" id="linknoteref-14193">14193</a> Arvad gave not
      only rowers to man the ships, but also men-at-arms to help in guarding the
      walls.<a href="#linknote-14194" name="linknoteref-14194"       id="linknoteref-14194">14194</a> The &ldquo;ancients of Gebal&rdquo; lent their aid in
      the Tyrian dockyards.<a href="#linknote-14195" name="linknoteref-14195"       id="linknoteref-14195">14195</a> The minor cities cannot have ventured to
      hold aloof. Tyre, as the time approached for the contest which was to
      decide whether Egypt or Babylon should be the great power of the East,
      appears to have reached the height of her strength, wealth, and
      prosperity. It is now that Ezekial says of her&mdash;&ldquo;O Tyrus, thy heart
      is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am a God, I sit in the seat of God in
      the midst of the seas&mdash;Behold, thou art wiser than Daniel, there is
      no secret that they can hide from thee: from thy wisdom and with thine
      understanding hast thou gotten thee riches, and hast gotten gold and
      silver into thy treasures: by thy great wisdom and by thy traffick thou
      hast increased thy riches, and thy heart is lifted up because of thy
      riches"<a href="#linknote-14196" name="linknoteref-14196"       id="linknoteref-14196">14196</a>; and again, &ldquo;O thou that are situated at
      the entry of the sea, which art the merchant of the peoples unto many
      isles, thus saith the Lord God, Thou, O Tyre, hast said, I am perfect in
      beauty. Thy borders are in the heart of the sea; thy builders have
      perfected thy beauty. They have made all thy planks of fir-trees from
      Senir; they have taken from Lebanon cedars to make masts for thee; of the
      oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; they have made thy benches of
      ivory, inlaid in boxwood, from the isles of Kittim . . . The ships of
      Tarshish were thy caravans for thy merchandise; and thou wast replenished,
      and made very glorious in the heart of the sea."<a href="#linknote-14197"       name="linknoteref-14197" id="linknoteref-14197">14197</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The first to strike of the two great antagonists was Egypt. Psamatik I.,
      who was advanced in years at the time of Assyria&rsquo;s downfall,<a
      href="#linknote-14198" name="linknoteref-14198" id="linknoteref-14198">14198</a>
      died about B.C. 610, and was succeeded by a son still in the full vigour
      of life, the brave and enterprising Neco. Neco, in B.C. 608, having made
      all due preparations, led a great expedition into Palestine,<a
      href="#linknote-14199" name="linknoteref-14199" id="linknoteref-14199">14199</a>
      with the object of bringing under his dominion the entire tract between
      the River of Egypt (Wady el Arish) and the Middle Euphrates. Already
      possessed of Ashdod<a href="#linknote-14200" name="linknoteref-14200"       id="linknoteref-14200">14200</a> and perhaps also of Gaza<a
      href="#linknote-14201" name="linknoteref-14201" id="linknoteref-14201">14201</a>
      and Askelon,<a href="#linknote-14202" name="linknoteref-14202"       id="linknoteref-14202">14202</a> he held the keys of Syria, and could have
      no difficulty in penetrating along the coast route, through the rich plain
      of Sharon, to the first of the mountain barriers which are interposed
      between the Nile and the Mesopotamian region. His famous fleet<a
      href="#linknote-14203" name="linknoteref-14203" id="linknoteref-14203">14203</a>
      would support him along the shore, at any rate as far Carmel; and Dor and
      Accho would probably be seized, and made into depôts for his stores and
      provisions. The powerful Egyptian monarch marching northward with his
      numerous and well-disciplined army, partly composed of native troops,
      partly of mercenaries from Asia Minor, Greeks and Carians, probably did
      not look to meet with any opposition, till, somewhere in Northern Syria,
      he should encounter the forces of Babylonia, which would of course be
      moved westward to meet him. What then must have been his surprise when he
      found the ridge connecting Carmel with the highland of Samaria occupied by
      a strong body of troops, and his further progress barred by a foe who had
      appeared to him too insignificant to be taken into account? Josiah, the
      Jewish monarch of the time, grandson of Manasseh and great-grandson of
      Hezekiah, who, in the unsettled state of Western Asia, had united under
      his dominion the entire country of the twelve tribes,<a
      href="#linknote-14204" name="linknoteref-14204" id="linknoteref-14204">14204</a>
      had quitted Jerusalem, and thrown himself across the would-be conqueror&rsquo;s
      path in the strong and well-known position of Megiddo. Here, in remote
      times, had the great Thothmes met and defeated the whole force of Syria
      and Mesopotamia under the king of Kadesh;<a href="#linknote-14205"       name="linknoteref-14205" id="linknoteref-14205">14205</a> here had Deborah
      and Barak, the son of Abinoam, utterly destroyed the mighty army of Jabin,
      king of Canaan, under Sisera.<a href="#linknote-14206"       name="linknoteref-14206" id="linknoteref-14206">14206</a> Here now the
      gallant, if rash, Judæan king elected to take his stand, moved either by a
      sense of duty, because he regarded himself as a Babylonian feudatory, or
      simply determined to defend the Holy Land against any heathen army that,
      without permission, trespassed on it. In vain did Neco seek to induce
      Josiah to retire and leave the way open, by assuring him that he had no
      hostile intentions against Judæa, but was marching on Carchemish by the
      Euphrates, there to contend with the Babylonians.<a href="#linknote-14207"       name="linknoteref-14207" id="linknoteref-14207">14207</a> The Jewish king
      persisted in his rash enterprise, and Neco was forced to brush him from
      his path. His seasoned and disciplined troops easily overcame the hasty
      levies of Josiah; and Josiah himself fell in the battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have no details with respect to the remainder of the expedition. Neco,
      no doubt, pressed forward through Galilee and Coele-Syria towards the
      Euphrates. Whether he had to fight any further battles we are not
      informed. It is certain that he occupied Carchemish,<a
      href="#linknote-14208" name="linknoteref-14208" id="linknoteref-14208">14208</a>
      and made it his headquarters, but whether it submitted to him, or was
      besieged and taken, is unknown. All Syria, Phoenicia, and Palestine were
      overrun, and became temporarily Egyptian possessions.<a
      href="#linknote-14209" name="linknoteref-14209" id="linknoteref-14209">14209</a>
      But Phoenicia does not appear to have been subdued by force. Tyrian
      prosperity continued, and the terms on which Phoenicia stood towards Egypt
      during the remainder of Neco&rsquo;s reign were friendly. Phoenicians at Neco&rsquo;s
      request accomplished the circumnavigation of Africa;<a
      href="#linknote-14210" name="linknoteref-14210" id="linknoteref-14210">14210</a>
      and we may suspect that it was Neco who granted to Tyre the extraordinary
      favour of settling a colony in the Egyptian capital, Memphis.<a
      href="#linknote-14211" name="linknoteref-14211" id="linknoteref-14211">14211</a>
      Probably Phoenicia accepted at the hands of Neco the same sort of position
      which she had at first occupied under Assyria, a position, as already
      explained, satisfactory to both parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the glory and prosperity which Egypt had thus acquired were very
      short-lived. Within three years Babylonia asserted herself. In B.C. 605,
      the crown prince, Nebuchadnezzar, acting on behalf of his father,
      Nabopolassar, who was aged and infirm,<a href="#linknote-14212"       name="linknoteref-14212" id="linknoteref-14212">14212</a> led the forces
      of Babylon against the audacious Pharaoh, who had dared to affront the
      &ldquo;King of kings,&rdquo; &ldquo;the Lord of Sumir and Accad,&rdquo; had taken him off his
      guard, and deprived him of some of his fairest provinces. Babylonia, under
      Nabopolassar and Nebuchadnezzar, was no unworthy successor of the mighty
      power which for seven hundred years had held the supremacy of Western
      Asia. Her citizens were as brave; her armies as well disciplined; her
      rulers as bold, as sagacious, and as unsparing. Habakkuk&rsquo;s description of
      a Babylonian army belongs to about this date, and is probably drawn from
      the life&mdash;&ldquo;Lo, I raise up the Chaldæans, that bitter and hasty
      nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the
      dwelling-places that are not theirs. They are terrible and dreadful; from
      them shall proceed judgment and captivity; their horses are swifter than
      leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves; and their horsemen
      shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they
      shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat. They shall come all for
      violence; their faces shall sup as the east wind, and they shall gather
      the captivity as the sand. And they shall scoff at kings, and princes
      shall be a scorn unto them; they shall derive every stronghold; for they
      shall heap dust, and take it."<a href="#linknote-14213"       name="linknoteref-14213" id="linknoteref-14213">14213</a> Early in the
      year B.C. 605 the host of Nebuchadnezzar appeared on the right bank of the
      Euphrates, moving steadily along its reaches, and day by day approaching
      nearer and nearer to the great fortress in and behind which lay the army
      of Neco, well ordered with shield and buckler, its horses harnessed, and
      its horsemen armed with spears that had been just furbished, and protected
      by helmets and brigandines.<a href="#linknote-14214"       name="linknoteref-14214" id="linknoteref-14214">14214</a> One of the
      &ldquo;decisive battles of the world&rdquo; was impending. If Egypt conquered,
      Oriental civilisation would take the heavy immovable Egyptian type;
      change, advance, progress would be hindered; sacerdotalism in religion,
      conventionalism in art, pure unmitigated despotism in government would
      generally prevail; all the throbbing life of Asia would receive a sudden
      and violent check; Semitism would be thrust back; Aryanism, just pushing
      itself to the front, would shrink away; the monotonous Egyptian tone of
      thought and life would spread, like a lava stream, over the manifold and
      varied forms of Asiatic culture; crushing them out, concealing them,
      making them as though they had never been. The victory of Babylon, on the
      other hand, would mean room for Semitism to develop itself, and for
      Aryanism to follow in its wake; fresh stirs of population and of thought
      in Asia; further advances in the arts; variety, freshness, growth; the
      continuance of the varied lines of Oriental study and investigation until
      such time as would enable Grecian intellect to take hold of them, sift
      them, and assimilate whatever in them was true, valuable, and capable of
      expansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have no historical account of the great battle of Carchemish. Jeremiah,
      however, beholds it in vision. He sees the Egyptians &ldquo;dismayed and turned
      away back&mdash;their mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled apace, and
      look not back, since fear is round about them."<a href="#linknote-14215"       name="linknoteref-14215" id="linknoteref-14215">14215</a> He sees the
      &ldquo;swift flee away,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;mighty men&rdquo; attempting to &ldquo;escape;&rdquo; but they
      &ldquo;stumble and fall toward the north by the river Euphrates."<a
      href="#linknote-14216" name="linknoteref-14216" id="linknoteref-14216">14216</a>
      &ldquo;For this is the day of the Lord God of hosts, a day of vengeance, that He
      may avenge Him of His adversaries; and the sword devours, and it is
      satiate and made drunk with their blood, for the Lord God of hosts hath a
      sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates."<a
      href="#linknote-14217" name="linknoteref-14217" id="linknoteref-14217">14217</a>
      The &ldquo;valiant men&rdquo; are &ldquo;swept away&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;many fall&mdash;yea, one falls
      upon another, and they say, Arise and let us go again to our own people,
      and to the land of our nativity from the oppressing sword."<a
      href="#linknote-14218" name="linknoteref-14218" id="linknoteref-14218">14218</a>
      Nor do the mercenaries escape. &ldquo;Her hired men are in the midst of her,
      like fatted bullocks; for they also are turned back, and are fled away
      together; they did not stand because the day of their calamity was come
      upon them, and the time of their visitation."<a href="#linknote-14219"       name="linknoteref-14219" id="linknoteref-14219">14219</a> The defeat was,
      beyond a doubt, complete, overwhelming. The shock of it was felt all over
      the Delta, at Memphis, and even at distant Thebes.<a href="#linknote-14220"       name="linknoteref-14220" id="linknoteref-14220">14220</a> The hasty flight
      of the entire Egyptian host left the whole country open to the invading
      army. &ldquo;Like a whirlwind, like a torrent, it swept on. The terrified
      inhabitants retired into the fortified cities,"<a href="#linknote-14221"       name="linknoteref-14221" id="linknoteref-14221">14221</a> where for the
      time they were safe. Nebuchadnezzar did not stop to commence any siege. He
      pursued Neco up to the very frontier of Egypt, and would have continued
      his victorious career into the Nile valley, had not important intelligence
      arrested his steps. His aged father had died at Babylon while he was
      engaged in his conquests, and his immediate return to the capital was
      necessary, if he would avoid a disputed succession.<a
      href="#linknote-14222" name="linknoteref-14222" id="linknoteref-14222">14222</a>
      Thus matters in Syria had to be left in a confused and unsettled state,
      until such time as the Great King could revisit the scene of his
      conquests, and place them upon some definite and satisfactory footing.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the whole, the campaign had, apparently, the effect of drawing closer
      the links which united Phoenicia with Egypt.<a href="#linknote-14223"       name="linknoteref-14223" id="linknoteref-14223">14223</a> Babylon had
      shown herself a fierce and formidable enemy, but had disgusted men more
      than she had terrified them. It was clear enough that she would be a hard
      mistress, a second and crueller Assyria. There was thus, on
      Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s departure, a general gravitation of the Syrian and
      Palestinian states towards Egypt, since they saw in her the only possible
      protector against Babylon, and dreaded her less than they did the &ldquo;bitter
      and hasty nation."<a href="#linknote-14224" name="linknoteref-14224"       id="linknoteref-14224">14224</a> Neco, no doubt, encouraged the movement
      which tended at once to strengthen himself and weaken his antagonist; and
      the result was that, in the course of a few years, both Judæa and
      Phoenicia revolted from Nebuchadnezzar, and declared themselves
      independent. Phoenicia was still under the hegemony of Tyre, and Tyre had
      at its head an enterprising prince, a second Ithobal,<a
      href="#linknote-14225" name="linknoteref-14225" id="linknoteref-14225">14225</a>
      who had developed its resources to the uttermost, and was warmly supported
      by the other cities.<a href="#linknote-14226" name="linknoteref-14226"       id="linknoteref-14226">14226</a> His revolt appears to have taken place in
      the year B.C. 598, the seventh year of Nebuchadnezzar.<a
      href="#linknote-14227" name="linknoteref-14227" id="linknoteref-14227">14227</a>
      Nebuchadnezzar at once marched against him in person. The sieges of Tyre,
      Sidon, and Jerusalem were formed. Jerusalem submitted almost immediately.<a
      href="#linknote-14228" name="linknoteref-14228" id="linknoteref-14228">14228</a>
      Sidon was taken after losing half her defenders by pestilence;<a
      href="#linknote-14229" name="linknoteref-14229" id="linknoteref-14229">14229</a>
      but Tyre continued to resist for the long space of thirteen years.<a
      href="#linknote-14230" name="linknoteref-14230" id="linknoteref-14230">14230</a>
      The continental city was probably taken first. Against this Nebuchadnezzar
      could freely employ his whole force&mdash;his &ldquo;horses, his chariots, his
      companies, and his much people&rdquo;&mdash;he could bring moveable forts close
      up to the walls, and cast up banks against them, and batter them with his
      engines, or undermine them with spade and mattock. When a breach was
      effected, he could pour his horse into the streets, and ride down all
      opposition. It is the capture of the continental city which Ezekiel
      describes when he says:<a href="#linknote-14231" name="linknoteref-14231"       id="linknoteref-14231">14231</a> &ldquo;Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will
      bring upon Tyrus Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, a king of kings, from
      the north, with horses and with chariots, and with horsemen, and
      companies, and much people. He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in
      the field; and he shall make a fort against thee, and cast a mount against
      thee, and lift up the buckler against thee. And he shall set engines of
      war against thy walls, and with his axes he shall break down thy towers.
      By reason of the abundance of his horses, their dust shall cover thee; thy
      walls shall shake at the noise of the horseman, and of the wheels and of
      the chariots, when he shall enter into thy gates, as men enter into a city
      wherein is made a breach. With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down
      all thy streets: he shall slay thy people by the sword, and thy strong
      garrisons shall go down to the ground. And they shall make a spoil of thy
      riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise; and they shall break down thy
      walls, and destroy thy pleasant houses: and they shall lay thy stones and
      thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water.&rdquo; But the island city
      did not escape. When continental Phoenicia was reduced, it was easy to
      impress a fleet from maritime towns; to man it, in part with Phoenicians,
      in part with Babylonians, no mean sailors,<a href="#linknote-14232"       name="linknoteref-14232" id="linknoteref-14232">14232</a> and then to
      establish a blockade of the isle. Tyre may more than once have crippled
      and dispersed the blockading squadron; but by a moderate expenditure fresh
      fleets could be supplied, while Tyre, cut off from Lebanon, would find it
      difficult to increase or renew her navy. There has been much question
      whether the island city was ultimately captured by Nebuchadnezzar or no;
      but even writers who take the negative view<a href="#linknote-14233"       name="linknoteref-14233" id="linknoteref-14233">14233</a> admit that it
      must have submitted and owned the suzerainty of its assailant. The date of
      the submission was B.C. 585.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Tyre, in B.C. 585, &ldquo;fell from her high estate.&rdquo; Ezekiel&rsquo;s prophecies
      were fulfilled. Ithobal II., the &ldquo;prince of Tyrus&rdquo; of those prophecies,<a
      href="#linknote-14234" name="linknoteref-14234" id="linknoteref-14234">14234</a>
      whose &ldquo;head had been lifted up,&rdquo; and who had said in his heart, &ldquo;I am a
      God, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the waters,&rdquo; who deemed
      himself &ldquo;wiser than Daniel,&rdquo; and thought that no secret was hid from him,
      was &ldquo;brought down to the pit,&rdquo; &ldquo;cast to the ground,&rdquo; &ldquo;brought to ashes
      upon the earth in the sight of all them that beheld him."<a
      href="#linknote-14235" name="linknoteref-14235" id="linknoteref-14235">14235</a>
      Tyre herself was &ldquo;broken in the midst of the seas."<a
      href="#linknote-14236" name="linknoteref-14236" id="linknoteref-14236">14236</a>
      A blight fell upon her. For many years, Sidon, rather than Tyre, became
      once more the leading city of Phoenicia, was regarded as pre-eminent in
      naval skill,<a href="#linknote-14237" name="linknoteref-14237"       id="linknoteref-14237">14237</a> and is placed before Tyre when the two
      are mentioned together.<a href="#linknote-14238" name="linknoteref-14238"       id="linknoteref-14238">14238</a> Internal convulsion, moreover, followed
      upon external decline. Within ten years of the death of Ithobal, the
      monarchy came to an end by a revolution,<a href="#linknote-14239"       name="linknoteref-14239" id="linknoteref-14239">14239</a> which
      substituted for Kings Suffetes or Shophetim, &ldquo;judges,&rdquo; officers of an
      inferior status, whose tenure of office was not very assured. Ecnibal, the
      son of Baslach, the first judge, held the position for no more than two
      months; Chelbes, the son of Abdæus, who followed him, ruled for ten
      months; Abbarus, a high priest, probably of Melkarth, for three months.
      Then, apparently to weaken the office, it was shared between two, as at
      Carthage, and Mytgon (perhaps Mattan), together with Ger-ashtoreth, the
      son of Abd-elim, judged Tyre for six years. But the partisans of monarchy
      were now recovering strength; and the reign of a king, Balator, was
      intruded at some point in the course of the six years&rsquo; judgeship. Judges
      were then abolished by a popular movement, and kings of the old stock
      restored. The Tyrians sent to Babylon for a certain Merbal, who must have
      been either a refugee or a hostage at the court of Neriglissar. He was
      allowed to return to Tyre, and, being confirmed in the sovereignty,
      reigned four years. His brother, Eirom, or Hiram, succeeded him, and was
      still upon the throne when the Empire of Babylon came to an end by the
      victory of Cyrus over Nabonidus (B.C. 538).
    </p>
    <p>
      Phoenicia under the Babylonian rule was exceptionally weak. She had to
      submit to attacks from Egypt under Apries, which fell probably in the
      reign of Baal over Tyre, about B.C. 565. She had also to submit to the
      loss of Cyprus under Amasis,<a href="#linknote-14240"       name="linknoteref-14240" id="linknoteref-14240">14240</a> probably about
      B.C. 540, or a little earlier, when the power of Babylon was rapidly
      declining. She had been, from first to last, an unwilling tributary of the
      Great Empire on the Lower Euphrates, and was perhaps not sorry to see that
      empire go down before the rising power of Persia. Under the circumstances
      she would view any chance as likely to advance her interests, and times of
      disturbance and unsettlement gave her the best chance of obtaining a
      temporary independence. From B.C. 538 to B.C. 528 or 527 she seems to have
      enjoyed one of these rare intervals of autonomy. Egypt, content with
      having annexed Cyprus, did not trouble her; Persia, engaged in wars in the
      far East,<a href="#linknote-14241" name="linknoteref-14241"       id="linknoteref-14241">14241</a> made as yet no claim to her allegiance.
      In peace and tranquillity she pursued her commercial career, covered the
      seas with her merchant vessels, and the land-routes of trade with her
      caravans, repaired the damages inflicted by Nebuchadnezzar on her cities;
      maintained, if she did not even increase, her naval strength, and waited
      patiently to see what course events would take now that Babylon was
      destroyed, and a new and hitherto unknown power was about to assume the
      first position among the nations of the earth.

    <p>
      The conquest of Babylon by Cyrus gave him, according to Oriental notions
      generally, a claim to succeed to the inheritance of the entire Babylonian
      empire; but the claim would remain dormant until it was enforced. The
      straggling character of the territory, which was shaped like a Greek {L},
      ascending from Babylon along the course of the Euphrates to the Armenian
      mountains, and then descending along the line of the Mediterranean coast
      as far as Gaza or Raphia, rendered the enforcement of the claim a work of
      difficulty, more especially in the remote West, which was distant fifteen
      hundred miles from Persia Proper, and more than a thousand miles from
      Babylon. Cyrus, moreover, was prevented, first by wars in his immediate
      neighbourhood,<a href="#linknote-14242" name="linknoteref-14242"       id="linknoteref-14242">14242</a> and later on by a danger upon his
      north-eastern frontier,<a href="#linknote-14243" name="linknoteref-14243"       id="linknoteref-14243">14243</a> from taking the steps usually taken by a
      conqueror to establish his dominion in a newly-annexed region, and thus he
      neither occupied Syria with troops, nor placed it under the administration
      of Persian governors. The only step which, so far as we know, he took,
      implying that his authority reached so far, was the commission which he
      gave to Zerubbabel and the other chiefs of the Jewish nation to proceed
      from Babylonia to Judæa, and re-establish themselves, if they could, on
      the site of the destroyed Jerusalem.<a href="#linknote-14244"       name="linknoteref-14244" id="linknoteref-14244">14244</a> The return from
      the Captivity which followed was in some sense the occupation of a portion
      of the extreme West by a Persian garrison, and may be viewed as a step
      intended to be &ldquo;preparatory towards obtaining possession of the entire
      sea-coast;"<a href="#linknote-14245" name="linknoteref-14245"       id="linknoteref-14245">14245</a> but it appears to have been an isolated
      movement, effected without active Persian support, and one whereby the
      neighbouring countries were only slightly affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Phoenicia retained her independence until the reign of Cambyses is
      distinctly implied, if not actually asserted, by Herodotus.<a
      href="#linknote-14246" name="linknoteref-14246" id="linknoteref-14246">14246</a>
      She saw without any displeasure the re-establishment in her neighbourhood
      of a nation with which her intercourse had always been friendly, and
      sometimes close and cordial. Tyre and Sidon vied with each other in their
      readiness to supply the returned exiles with the timber which they needed
      for the rebuilding of their temple and city; and once more, as in the days
      of Solomon, the Jewish axes were heard amid the groves of Lebanon, and the
      magnificent cedars of that favoured region were cut down, conveyed to the
      coast, and made into floats or rafts, which Phoenician mariners
      transported by sea to Joppa, the nearest seaport to Jerusalem.<a
      href="#linknote-14247" name="linknoteref-14247" id="linknoteref-14247">14247</a>
      In return, the Jews willingly rendered to the Phoenicians such an amount
      of corn, wine, and oil as was equivalent in value to the timber received
      from them,<a href="#linknote-14248" name="linknoteref-14248"       id="linknoteref-14248">14248</a> and thus the relations between the two
      peoples were replaced on a footing which recalled the time of their
      closest friendship, nearly five hundred years previously.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the death of Cyrus, and the accession of his son Cambyses, B.C. 529,
      the tranquillity which South-western Asia had enjoyed since the time of
      the wars of Nebuchadnezzar came to an end. Cyrus had, it is said, designed
      an expedition against Egypt,<a href="#linknote-14249"       name="linknoteref-14249" id="linknoteref-14249">14249</a> as necessary to
      round off his conquests, and Cambyses naturally inherited his father&rsquo;s
      projects. He had no sooner mounted the throne than he commenced
      preparations for an attack upon the ancient kingdom of the Pharaohs,
      which, under the dynasty of the Psamatiks, had risen to something of its
      early greatness, and had been especially wealthy and prosperous under the
      usurper Amasis.<a href="#linknote-14250" name="linknoteref-14250"       id="linknoteref-14250">14250</a> It was impossible to allow an independent
      and rival monarchy so close upon his borders, and equally impossible to
      shrink from an enterprise which had been carried to a successful issue
      both by Assyria and by Babylon. Persian prestige required the subjugation
      and absorption of a country which, though belonging geographically to
      Africa, was politically and commercially an integral part of that Western
      Asia over which Persia claimed a complete and absolute supremacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The march upon Egypt implied and required the occupation of the
      Mediterranean seaboard. No armies of any considerable size have ever
      attempted to traverse the almost waterless desert which separates the
      Lower Euphrates valley from the delta of the Nile. Light <i>corps d&rsquo;armée</i>
      have no doubt occasionally passed from Circesium by way of Tadmor to
      Damascus, and <i>vice versâ</i>;<a href="#linknote-14251"       name="linknoteref-14251" id="linknoteref-14251">14251</a> but the ordinary
      line of route pursued by conquerors follows the course of the Euphrates to
      Carchemish, then strikes across the chalky upland in the middle of which
      stands the city of Aleppo, and finally descends upon Egypt by way of the
      Orontes, the Coele-Syrian valley, and the plains of Sharon and Philistia.<a
      href="#linknote-14252" name="linknoteref-14252" id="linknoteref-14252">14252</a>
      This was undoubtedly the line followed by Cambyses,<a
      href="#linknote-14253" name="linknoteref-14253" id="linknoteref-14253">14253</a>
      and it necessarily brought him into contact with the Phoenicians. The
      contact was not an hostile one. It would have been madness on the part of
      the Phoenicians to have attempted any resistance to the vast host with
      which Cambyses, we may be sure, made his invasion, and it would have been
      folly on the part of Cambyses to employ force when he could better obtain
      his object by persuasion. It must have been a very special object with him
      to obtain the hearty co-operation of the Phoenician naval forces in the
      attack which he was meditating, since he would otherwise have had no fleet
      at all capable of coping with the fleet of Egypt. Neco had made Egypt a
      strong naval power;<a href="#linknote-14254" name="linknoteref-14254"       id="linknoteref-14254">14254</a> Apries had contented for naval supremacy
      in the Eastern Mediterranean with Tyre;<a href="#linknote-14255"       name="linknoteref-14255" id="linknoteref-14255">14255</a> Amasis had made
      an expedition by sea against Cyprus, had crushed whatever resistance the
      Cyprians were able to offer, had permanently occupied the island,<a
      href="#linknote-14256" name="linknoteref-14256" id="linknoteref-14256">14256</a>
      and added the Cyprian fleet to his own. Cambyses had as yet no ships,
      except such as he could procure from the Greek cities of Asia Minor, which
      were not likely to be very zealous in his service, since they had friends
      engaged upon the other side.<a href="#linknote-14257"       name="linknoteref-14257" id="linknoteref-14257">14257</a> Accordingly, the
      Persian monarch seems to have made friendly overtures to the Phoenician
      states, which were received with favour, and led to an arrangement
      satisfactory to both parties. Phoenicia surrendered the independence which
      it was impossible for her to maintain, and placed her fleet at the
      disposal of Persia.<a href="#linknote-14258" name="linknoteref-14258"       id="linknoteref-14258">14258</a> Persia spared her cities any occupation,
      imposed on her a light tribute, and allowed her that qualified
      independence which is implied in the retention of her native princes. From
      first to last under the Persian <i>régime</i>, Phoenician monarchs bear
      rule in the Phoenician cities,<a href="#linknote-14259"       name="linknoteref-14259" id="linknoteref-14259">14259</a> and command the
      contingents which the cities furnish to any combined Persian fleet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The friendly arrangement concluded between Phoenicia and Persia was
      followed, very naturally, by a further accession to the Persian power.
      Cyprus, whose population was in great part Phoenician, had for centuries
      been connected politically in the closest manner with the Phoenician towns
      on the Asiatic mainland, especially with Tyre and Sidon. Her enslavement
      by Amasis must have been hateful to her, and she must have been only too
      glad to see an opportunity of shaking off the Egyptian yoke. Accordingly,
      no sooner did the Phoenicians of the mainland conclude the arrangement by
      which they became part and parcel of the Persian Empire than the Cyprians
      followed their example, and, revolting from Egypt, offered themselves of
      their own free will to Persia.<a href="#linknote-14260"       name="linknoteref-14260" id="linknoteref-14260">14260</a> Cambyses, it is
      needless to say, readily accepted them as his subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      The invasion of Egypt could now be taken in hand with every prospect of a
      successful issue. The march of the land army along the shore would be
      supported by a parallel movement on the part of a powerful fleet, which
      would carry its provisions and its water, explore the country in front,
      and give notice of the movements of the enemy, and of the place where they
      proposed to make a stand in force. When Egypt was reached the fleet would
      command all the navigable mouths of the Nile, would easily establish a
      blockade of all ports, and might even mount the Nile and take a part in
      the siege of Memphis. It would seem that all these services were rendered
      to the Persian monarch by the great fleet which he had collected, of which
      the Phoenician ships were recognised as the main strength. The rapid
      conquest of Egypt was in this way much facilitated, and Cambyses within a
      twelvemonth found himself in possession of the entire country within its
      recognised limits of the Mediterranean and &ldquo;the tower of Syêné."<a
      href="#linknote-14261" name="linknoteref-14261" id="linknoteref-14261">14261</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Great King was not satisfied with a single, albeit a magnificent,
      achievement. He had accomplished in one short campaign what it took the
      Assyrians ten years, and Nebuchadnezzar eighteen years, to effect. But he
      now set his heart on further conquests. &ldquo;He designed,&rdquo; says Herodotus,<a
      href="#linknote-14262" name="linknoteref-14262" id="linknoteref-14262">14262</a>
      &ldquo;three great expeditions. One was to be against the Carthaginians, another
      against the Ammonians, and a third against the long-lived Ethopians, who
      dwelt in that part of Lybia which borders upon the southern sea.&rdquo; The
      expedition against the Carthaginians is the only one of the three which
      here concerns us: it was to be entrusted to the fleet. Instead of
      conducting, or sending, a land force along the seaboard of North Africa,
      which was probably known to be for the most part barren and waterless,
      Cambyses judged that it would be sufficient to dispatch his powerful navy
      against the Liby-Phoenician colony, which he supposed would submit or else
      be subjugated. But on broaching this plan to the leaders of the fleet he
      was met with a determined opposition. The Phoenicians positively refused
      to proceed against their own colonists. They urged that they were bound to
      the Carthaginians by most solemn oaths, and that it would be as wicked and
      unnatural for them to execute the king&rsquo;s orders as for parents to destroy
      their own children.<a href="#linknote-14263" name="linknoteref-14263"       id="linknoteref-14263">14263</a> It was a bold act to run counter to the
      will of a despotic monarch, especially of one so headstrong and impetuous
      as Cambyses. But the Phoenicians were firm, and the monarch yielded. &ldquo;He
      did not like,&rdquo; Herodotus says, &ldquo;to force the war upon the Phoenicians,
      because they had surrendered themselves to the Persians, and because on
      the Phoenicians his entire sea-service depended.&rdquo; He therefore allowed
      their opposition to prevail, and desisted from his proposed undertaking.<a
      href="#linknote-14264" name="linknoteref-14264" id="linknoteref-14264">14264</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This acquiescence in their wishes on the part of the Great King, and his
      abstinence from any attempt at compulsion, would seem to have paved the
      way for that thoroughly good understanding between the suzerain power and
      her dependency which characterises the relations of the two for the next
      century and a half, with the single exception of one short interval. &ldquo;The
      navy of Phoenicia became a regular and very important part of the public
      power"<a href="#linknote-14265" name="linknoteref-14265"       id="linknoteref-14265">14265</a> of the Persian state. Complete confidence
      was felt by their Persian masters in the fidelity, attachment, and hearty
      good-will of the Phoenician people. Exceptional favour was shown them. Not
      only were they allowed to maintain their native kings, their municipal
      administration, their national laws and religion, but they were granted
      exceptional honours and exceptional privileges and immunities. The Great
      King maintained a park and royal residence in some portion of Phoenicia,<a
      href="#linknote-14266" name="linknoteref-14266" id="linknoteref-14266">14266</a>
      probably in the vicinity of Sidon,<a href="#linknote-14267"       name="linknoteref-14267" id="linknoteref-14267">14267</a> and no doubt
      allowed his faithful subjects to bask occasionally in the sunshine of his
      presence. When the internal organisation of the empire was taken in hand,
      and something approaching to a uniform system of government established
      for revenue purposes, though Phoenicia could not be excused from
      contributing to the taxation of the empire, yet the burden laid upon her
      seems to have been exceptionally light. United in a satrapy&mdash;the
      fifth&mdash;with Syria, Cyprus, and Palestine, and taxed according to her
      population rather than according to her wealth, she paid a share&mdash;probably
      not more than a third or a fourth&mdash;of 350 talents,<a
      href="#linknote-14268" name="linknoteref-14268" id="linknoteref-14268">14268</a>
      or an annual contribution to the needs of the empire amounting to no less
      than 30,000l. Persia, moreover, encouraged Phoenicia to establish an
      internal organisation of her own, and, under her suzerainty, Tyre, Sidon,
      and Aradus were united by federal bonds, and had a common council, which
      met at Tripolis, probably of three hundred members.<a
      href="#linknote-14269" name="linknoteref-14269" id="linknoteref-14269">14269</a>
      This council debated matters in which Phoenicia generally was interested,
      and, in times of disturbance, decided questions of peace and war.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reign of Darius Hystaspis (B.C. 521-486), the successor of Cambyses
      upon the Persian throne, introduced several changes into the Persian
      governmental system which were of advantage to the Phoenicians. Darius
      united the most distant parts of his empire by postal routes, along which
      at moderate intervals were maintained post-houses, with relays of horses,<a
      href="#linknote-14270" name="linknoteref-14270" id="linknoteref-14270">14270</a>
      primarily for the use of the government, but at the service of the
      traveller or private trader when not needed for business of state.
      Phoenician commerce must have been much helped by these arrangements,
      which facilitated rapid communication, gave security to lines of route
      which had been previously infested with robbers, and provided
      resting-places for the companies of merchants and traders, not unlike the
      caravanserai of modern Turkey and Persia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darius also established throughout his vast empire a uniform coinage,
      based apparently on that which had previously prevailed in Lydia. His
      &ldquo;darics,&rdquo; as they were called by the Greeks, were, in the first instance,
      gold coins of a rude type, a little heavier than our sovereigns, weighing
      between 123 and 124 grains troy.<a href="#linknote-14271"       name="linknoteref-14271" id="linknoteref-14271">14271</a> They bore the
      figure of an archer on the obverse, and on the reverse a very rough and
      primitive <i>quadratum incusum</i>. Darius must have coined them in vast
      abundance, since early in the reign of his successor a single individual
      of no great eminence had accumulated as many as 3,993,000 of them.<a
      href="#linknote-14272" name="linknoteref-14272" id="linknoteref-14272">14272</a>
      Subsequently to the introduction of the gold darics, a silver coinage was
      issued, originally (we are told) in Egypt by a Persian satrap called
      Aryandes,<a href="#linknote-14273" name="linknoteref-14273"       id="linknoteref-14273">14273</a> but afterwards by the central government.
      The name of &ldquo;daric&rdquo; was extended to these coins also, which, however, were
      much larger and heavier than the gold coins, weighing as much as 235
      grains, and corresponding to the Greek tetradrachm, and (nearly) to the
      Hebrew shekel. The establishment of this excellent circulating medium, and
      the wide extension which it almost immediately attained, must have given
      an enormous stimulus to trade, and have been found of the greatest
      convenience by the Phoenician merchants, who had no longer to carry with
      them the precious metal in bars or ingots, and to weigh their gold and
      silver in the balance in connection with every purchase that they made,
      but could effect both sales and purchases in the simple and commodious
      manner still in use among all civilised nations at the present day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under these circumstances we can well understand that the Phoenicians were
      thoroughly satisfied with the position which they occupied under the
      earlier Persian kings, and strove zealously to maintain and extend the
      empire to which they owed so much. Their fidelity was put to a crucial
      test after they had been subjects of Darius Hystaspis for a little more
      than twenty years, and had had about fourteen or fifteen years&rsquo; experience
      of the advantages of his governmental system. Aristagoras of Miletus,
      finding himself in a position of difficulty, had lighted up the flames of
      war in Asia Minor, and brought about a general revolt of the Greeks in
      those parts against the Persian power&mdash;a revolt which spread on from
      the Greeks to the native Asiatics, and in a short time embraced, not only
      Ionia and Æolis, but Caria, Caunus, and almost the whole of Cyprus.<a
      href="#linknote-14274" name="linknoteref-14274" id="linknoteref-14274">14274</a>
      The bulk of the Cyprian cities were Phoenician colonies, and the political
      connection between these cities and Phoenicia was so close and of such
      ancient date that the Phoenicians can scarcely have failed to be moved by
      their example and by their danger. A wave of sympathy might have been
      expected to sweep across the excitable people, and it would not have been
      surprising had they rushed headlong into rebellion with the same
      impetuosity as their Cyprian brethren. Had they done so the danger to
      Persia would have been very great, and the course of the world&rsquo;s history
      might perhaps have been differently shaped. The junction of the Phoenician
      fleet with the navies of Cyprus, Ionia, Caria, and Æolis would have
      transferred the complete sovereignty of the Eastern Mediterranean to the
      side of the rebels.<a href="#linknote-14275" name="linknoteref-14275"       id="linknoteref-14275">14275</a> The contagion of revolt would probably
      have spread. Lycia and Cilicia, always eager for independence,<a
      href="#linknote-14276" name="linknoteref-14276" id="linknoteref-14276">14276</a>
      would probably have joined the malcontents; Pamphylia, which lay between
      them, would have followed their example; the entire seaboard of Asia Minor
      and Syria would have been lost; Egypt would, most likely, have seen in the
      crisis her opportunity, and have avenged the cruelties and insults of
      Cambyses<a href="#linknote-14277" name="linknoteref-14277"       id="linknoteref-14277">14277</a> by the massacre of her Persian garrison.
      Persia&rsquo;s prosperity would have received a sudden check, from which it
      might never have recovered; Greece would have escaped the ordeal of the
      invasion of Xerxes; and the character of the struggle between Europe and
      Asia would have been completely altered.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the view which the Phoenicians took of their duties, or of their
      interests, led them to act differently. When the Persians, anxious to
      recover Cyprus, applied to the Phoenician cities for a naval force, to
      transport their army from Cilica to the island, and otherwise help them in
      the war, their request was at once complied with. Ships were sent to the
      Cilician coast without any delay;<a href="#linknote-14278"       name="linknoteref-14278" id="linknoteref-14278">14278</a> the Persian land
      force was conveyed in safety across the strait and landed on the opposite
      shore; the ships then rounded Cape St. Andreas and anchored in the bay
      opposite Salamis, where the Ionian fleet was drawn up in defence of the
      town.<a href="#linknote-14279" name="linknoteref-14279"       id="linknoteref-14279">14279</a> An engagement followed&mdash;the first,
      so far as we know, between Phoenicians and Greeks&mdash;wholly to the
      advantage of the latter.<a href="#linknote-14280" name="linknoteref-14280"       id="linknoteref-14280">14280</a> No complaint, however, is made of any
      lukewarmness, or want of zeal, on the part of the Phoenicians, who seem to
      have been beaten in fair fight by an enemy whom they had perhaps despised.
      Their ill fortune did not lead to any very serious result, since the
      Persian land force defeated the Cyprians, and thus Persia once more
      obtained possession of the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      A year or two later the Phoenicians recovered their lost laurels. In B.C.
      495 the Persians, having trampled out the flames of revolt in Cyprus,
      Caria, and Caunus, resolved on a great effort to bring the war to a close
      by attacking the Ionian Greeks in their own country, and crushing the head
      and front of the rebellion, which was the great and flourishing city of
      Miletus. Miletus lay on the southern shore of a deep bay&mdash;the Sinus
      Latmicus&mdash;which penetrated the western coast of Asia Minor in about
      Lat. 37º 30´, but which the deposits of the Mæander have now filled up.<a
      href="#linknote-14281" name="linknoteref-14281" id="linknoteref-14281">14281</a>
      North-west of the town, at the distance of about a mile, was the small
      island of Ladé, now a mere hillock on the flat alluvial plain. While the
      Persian land force advanced along the shore, and invested Milestus on the
      side towards the continent, a combined fleet of six hundred vessels<a
      href="#linknote-14282" name="linknoteref-14282" id="linknoteref-14282">14282</a>
      proceeded to block the entrance to the bay, and to threaten the doomed
      city from the sea. This fleet was drawn from four only of the countries
      subject to Persia&mdash;viz. Phoenicia, Cilicia, Cyprus, and Egypt&mdash;whereof
      Phoenicia, we are told, &ldquo;showed the greatest zeal,"<a
      href="#linknote-14283" name="linknoteref-14283" id="linknoteref-14283">14283</a>
      and we may presume furnished by far the larger number of ships. On their
      arrival in Milesian waters the captains found a strong naval force
      collected to meet them, which rested upon the island of Ladé, and guarded
      the approaches to the town. Miletus had summoned to her aid the
      contingents of her various allies&mdash;Chios, Lesbos, Samos, Teos,
      Priene, Erythræ, Phocæa, Myus&mdash;and had succeeded in gathering
      together a fleet amounting to above three hundred and fifty vessels.<a
      href="#linknote-14284" name="linknoteref-14284" id="linknoteref-14284">14284</a>
      This time Phoenicia did not despise her foe. Before engaging, every effort
      was made to sow discord and dissension among the confederates, and induce
      the Greek captains to withdraw their squadrons, or at any rate to remain
      neutral in the battle.<a href="#linknote-14285" name="linknoteref-14285"       id="linknoteref-14285">14285</a> Considerable effect was produced by these
      machinations; and when at last the attack was made, two of the principal
      of the Greek allies<a href="#linknote-14286" name="linknoteref-14286"       id="linknoteref-14286">14286</a> drew off, and sailed homewards, leaving
      the rest of the confederates to their fate. Yet, notwithstanding this
      defection, the battle was stoutly contested by the ships which remained,
      especially those of the Chians,<a href="#linknote-14287"       name="linknoteref-14287" id="linknoteref-14287">14287</a> and though a
      very decisive and complete victory was ultimately gained by the
      Phoenicians and their allies, the cost of the victory was great. Persia
      regained her naval supremacy in the Eastern Mediterranean; Phoenicia
      re-established her claim to be considered the great sea power of the time;
      but she lost a large number of her best vessels and seamen, and she was
      taught the lesson that, to cope with Greeks, she must have a vast
      superiority of force upon her side&mdash;a superiority of not much less
      than three to one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miletus soon fell after the victory of Ladé, and the Phoenician fleet was
      then employed for some time in chastising the islanders who had taken part
      in the revolt, and in reducing various towns upon the European shores of
      the Hellespont, the Propontis, and the Bosphorus, including Perinthus,
      Selymbria, and Byzantium.<a href="#linknote-14288" name="linknoteref-14288"       id="linknoteref-14288">14288</a> Miltiades, the destined hero of Marathon,
      narrowly escaped capture at the hands of the Phoenicians at this time, as
      he fled from his government in the Thracian Chersonese to Athens. The
      vessel which bore him just escaped into the harbour of Imbrus; but his
      son, Metiochus, who was on board a worse sailer, was less fortunate. The
      Phoenicians captured him, and, learning who he was, conveyed him to Darius
      at Susa, where he was well treated and became a naturalised Persian.<a
      href="#linknote-14289" name="linknoteref-14289" id="linknoteref-14289">14289</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      After the Ionian revolt had been completely put down and avenged, the
      states subject to Persia, and the Phoenicians among them, enjoyed a brief
      period of repose. But soon the restless spirit which possessed all the
      earlier Persian monarchs incited Darius to carry his warlike enterprises
      into &ldquo;fresh fields and pastures new.&rdquo; From the eastern coast of the Ægean
      Sea he looked out towards a land possessing every attraction that soil or
      clime could offer, fertile, rich in minerals, and with many excellent
      harbours, well watered, abounding in corn and wine and oil, in wooded
      hillsides, and in productive plains. According to Herodotus,<a
      href="#linknote-14290" name="linknoteref-14290" id="linknoteref-14290">14290</a>
      he had already explored the strength and weakness of the region by means
      of a commission of Persian nobles, who had surveyed all the shores of
      Greece from the decks of Phoenician ships. The result was that he coveted
      the possession of the land thus made known to him, and came to a fixed
      resolution that he would add it to his territories.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two modes by which Greece might be approached from Asia.
      Bridges of boats could be thrown across the Bosphorus or the Hellespont,
      mere salt rivers, scarcely more formidable than the streams of the
      Euphrates and the Tigris. In this way Europe could be invaded in force,
      and the army sent across the straits, could pursue its way along the shore
      till it reached the rich plains of Thessaly, and from Thessaly passed into
      Boetia, Attica, and the Peloponnese. Or a fleet, with a land force on
      board, might proceed from Asia Minor across the Ægean, where the numerous
      islands, scattered at short intervals, seemed to have been arranged by
      nature as stepping-stones, whereby the adventurous denizens of either
      continent might cross easily into the other; and a landing might be
      suddenly effected near the very heart of Greece without a tenth part of
      the trouble that must be taken if the other line of route were pursued. In
      either case the attendance of a fleet would be necessary. If the more
      circuitous route were pursued, a powerful squadron must attend the march
      of the army along the shore, to convey its supplies; if the direct route
      were preferred, a still larger fleet would be necessary for the
      conveyance, not only of the supplies, but of the army itself. Darius gave
      a trial to each of the two plans. In the year B.C. 492 he sent a fleet and
      army under Mardonius by way of the Hellespont and the European coast; but
      this expedition met with severe disasters, the fleet being shattered by a
      storm off Mount Athos, and the land force greatly damaged by a night
      attack on the part of the Thracians.<a href="#linknote-14291"       name="linknoteref-14291" id="linknoteref-14291">14291</a> Two years later
      he dispatched the famous expedition under Datis and Artaphernes, which
      took its course through the islands, and landed perhaps 200,000 men on the
      plain of Marathon,<a href="#linknote-14292" name="linknoteref-14292"       id="linknoteref-14292">14292</a> but being there defeated by Miltiades,
      returned hastily to Asia by the sea route. The fleets employed on both
      these occasions were numerous,<a href="#linknote-14293"       name="linknoteref-14293" id="linknoteref-14293">14293</a> and appear to
      have been collected from several of the Persian maritime states;<a
      href="#linknote-14294" name="linknoteref-14294" id="linknoteref-14294">14294</a>
      the proportion which the several contingents bore one to another is not
      stated, but there can be little doubt that the Phoenicians contributed the
      greater number. We have no details of the conduct of the Phoenicians on
      either occasion, beyond a casual notice that in the expedition of Datis
      and Artaphernes one of their vessels plundered the temple of Delium on the
      Boeotian coast opposite Chalcis, carrying off from it an image of Apollo
      plated with gold.<a href="#linknote-14295" name="linknoteref-14295"       id="linknoteref-14295">14295</a> The superstition of Datis deprived them
      of this valuable booty; but we may safely conclude from the anecdote that,
      while rendering service to Persia, the keen-witted mariners took care not
      to neglect their own material interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the third and greatest of the expeditions conducted by Persia against
      Greece, the Phoenicians are found to have played a very important and
      prominent part. Even before the expedition commenced, a call was made upon
      them in connection with it for services of an unusual character. The loss
      of the fleet of Mardonius off Mount Athos induced Xerxes to determine on
      cutting a ship-canal through the isthmus which joins Athos to the
      mainland; and his passion for great and striking achievements caused him
      to project the construction of a double bridge of boats across the
      Hellespont. Phoenician technical skill was invoked for the furtherance of
      both objects. At Athos they worked in conjunction with the maritime states
      generally, but showed an amount of engineering knowledge far in advance of
      their fellow-labourers. The others attempted to give perpendicular sides
      to their portions of the excavation, but found the sides continually fall
      in, and so (as Herodotus observes) &ldquo;had double labour."<a
      href="#linknote-14296" name="linknoteref-14296" id="linknoteref-14296">14296</a>
      The Phoenicians alone knew that the sides must be sloped at an angle, and,
      calculating the proper slope aright, performed their share of the task
      without mishap. At the Hellespont the Phoenicians had for co-partners the
      Egyptians only, and the two nations appear to have displayed an equal
      ability.<a href="#linknote-14297" name="linknoteref-14297"       id="linknoteref-14297">14297</a> Cables were passed from shore to shore,
      made taut by capstans and supported by an almost continuous line of boats;
      planks were then laid upon the cables, and covered with brushwood, while a
      thick layer of earth was placed upon the top. A solid causeway was thus
      formed, which was guarded on either side by bulwarks of such a height that
      the horses which crossed the bridge could not see over them; and thus the
      cavalry and the sumpter beasts passed from one continent to the other
      without a suspicion that they had ever had anything but <i>terra firma</i>
      under them. The structure served its purpose, but was not found strong
      enough to defy even for a year the forces of the winds and waves. Before
      the return of Xerxes, towards the close of B.C. 480, the autumnal gales
      had broken it up; and the army which accompanied him had to re-cross the
      strait in a number of separate ships.<a href="#linknote-14298"       name="linknoteref-14298" id="linknoteref-14298">14298</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The fleet which Xerxes collected to accompany his land army and take part
      in his great expedition amounted, it is said, to a total of 1207 vessels.<a
      href="#linknote-14299" name="linknoteref-14299" id="linknoteref-14299">14299</a>
      Of these the Phoenician triremes were at once the most numerous and the
      best. While Egypt furnished 200 ships, Cyprus 150, Cilicia, Ionia, and the
      Hellespontine Greeks 100 each, and the other maritime nations, all
      together, 257, Phoenicia singly contributed no fewer than 300.<a
      href="#linknote-14300" name="linknoteref-14300" id="linknoteref-14300">14300</a>
      The superiority of the Phoenician vessels was sufficiently shown, first by
      the regatta at Abydos, which was won by a Sidonian trireme;<a
      href="#linknote-14301" name="linknoteref-14301" id="linknoteref-14301">14301</a>
      next, by the preference of Xerxes for Phoenician over other vessels;<a
      href="#linknote-14302" name="linknoteref-14302" id="linknoteref-14302">14302</a>
      and, thirdly, by the position assigned them at Salamis, where care was
      taken to pit them against the Athenians,<a href="#linknote-14303"       name="linknoteref-14303" id="linknoteref-14303">14303</a> who were
      recognised as superior at sea to all the other Greeks. If the Phoenician
      prowess and naval skill did not succeed in averting defeat from the
      Persians, we must ascribe it first to the narrowness of the seas in which
      they had to engage the enemy; and, secondly, to the still greater prowess
      and skill of their principal antagonists, the Athenians, the Eginetans,
      and the Corinthians.
    </p>

      In the naval combats at Artemisium, the Egyptians, according to Herodotus,<a
      href="#linknote-14304" name="linknoteref-14304" id="linknoteref-14304">14304</a>
      were considered to have borne off the palm on the Persian side; but
      Diodorus assigns that honour to the Sidonians.<a href="#linknote-14305"       name="linknoteref-14305" id="linknoteref-14305">14305</a> At Salamis the
      brunt of the conflict fell on the Phoenician contingent, which began the
      battle,<a href="#linknote-14306" name="linknoteref-14306"       id="linknoteref-14306">14306</a> and for some time forced the Athenian
      squadron to beat a retreat, but was ultimately overpowered and forced to
      take to flight, after suffering great losses. A large number of the ships
      were sunk; several were taken by the Greeks; comparatively few escaped
      from the battle without serious injury.<a href="#linknote-14307"       name="linknoteref-14307" id="linknoteref-14307">14307</a> Xerxes, however,
      who from his silver-footed throne on Mount Ægaleos surveyed the scene,<a
      href="#linknote-14308" name="linknoteref-14308" id="linknoteref-14308">14308</a>
      but, amid the general turmoil and confusion, could ill distinguish the
      conduct of the several contingents, enraged at the loss of the battle, and
      regarding the Phoenicians as answerable for the unhappy result, since they
      formed the nucleus and chief strength of the fleet, laid the whole blame
      of the failure upon them, and, on some of the captains appearing before
      him to excuse themselves, had them beheaded upon the spot.<a
      href="#linknote-14309" name="linknoteref-14309" id="linknoteref-14309">14309</a>
      At the same time he also threatened the other Phoenician commanders with
      his vengeance, and so alarmed them that, according to Diodorus,<a
      href="#linknote-14310" name="linknoteref-14310" id="linknoteref-14310">14310</a>
      they quitted the fleet and sailed away to Asia.
    </p>
    <p>
      This harsh and unjust treatment seems to have led to an estrangement
      between the Persians and the foremost of the naval nations subject to
      them, which lasted for fifteen years. The Persians naturally distrusted
      those whom they had injured, and were unwilling to call them in to their
      aid. The Phoenicians probably brooded over their wrongs, and abstained
      from volunteering an assistance which they were not asked to furnish. The
      war between Persia and Greece continued, and was transferred from Europe
      to Asia, but no Phoenicians are mentioned as taking part in it. The
      Phoenician ships retired from Samos on the approach of the Greek fleet
      under Leotychides.<a href="#linknote-14311" name="linknoteref-14311"       id="linknoteref-14311">14311</a> No Phoenicians fought at Mycale. None are
      heard of as engaged at Sestos, or Byzantium, or Eïon, or Doriscus, or even
      Phaselis. It was not until&mdash;in B.C. 465&mdash;the war passed from the
      Ægean to the southern coast of Asia Minor, and their dependency, Cyprus,
      was threatened, that the Phoenicians again appeared upon the scene, and
      mustered in strength to the support of their Persian suzerain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Persian fleet which fought at the Eurymedon is said to have consisted
      of three hundred and forty vessels, drawn from the three subject nations
      of the Phoenicians, the Cyprians, and the Cilicians.<a
      href="#linknote-14312" name="linknoteref-14312" id="linknoteref-14312">14312</a>
      It was under the command of Tithraustes, a son of Xerxes. Cimon, who led
      the fleet of the Athenians and their allies, attacked it with a force of
      250 triremes, of which Athens had furnished the greater number. The battle
      was contested with extreme obstinacy on both sides; but at length the
      Athenians prevailed, and besides destroying a large number of the enemy&rsquo;s
      vessels, took as many as a hundred with their crews on board. At the same
      time a land victory was gained over the Persian troops. The double exploit
      was regarded as one of the most glorious in the annals of Greece, and was
      commemorated at Delos by a tablet with the following inscription:&mdash;<a
      href="#linknote-14313" name="linknoteref-14313" id="linknoteref-14313">14313</a>
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Since first the sea Europe from Asia severed,
     \    And Mars to rage &lsquo;mid humankind began,
     Never was such a blow as this delivered
     \    On land and sea at once by mortal man.
     These heroes did to death a host of Medes
     \    Near Cyprus, and then captured with their crews
     \    Five score Phoenician vessels; at the news

</pre>
    <p>
      It is scarcely necessary to follow further in detail the services which
      Phoenicia rendered to Persia as her submissive and attached ally. For the
      space of about seventy-five years from the date of the engagement at the
      Eurymedon (B.C. 465-390), the Phoenicians continued to hold the first
      place among the Persian naval states, and to render their mistress
      effective help in all her naval enterprises. They protected Cyprus and
      Egypt from the Athenian attacks, bore their part in the war with Amyrtæus
      and Inaros, and more than once inflicted severe blows upon the Athenian
      navy.<a href="#linknote-14314" name="linknoteref-14314"       id="linknoteref-14314">14314</a> It was his command of a Phoenician fleet
      amounting to nearly a hundred and fifty triremes which enabled
      Tissaphernes to play so influential a part in Asia Minor during the later
      years of the Peloponnesian war. It was the presence of their ships at
      Cnidus which, in B.C. 394, turned the scale between Athens and Sparta,
      enabling the Athenians to recover the naval supremacy which they had lost
      at Ægos-Potami. It was the appearance of a Phoenician fleet in Greek
      waters<a href="#linknote-14315" name="linknoteref-14315"       id="linknoteref-14315">14315</a> which, in the following year, gave an
      opportunity to the Athenians to rebuild their &ldquo;Long Walls,&rdquo; alarmed Sparta
      for her own safety, and extorted from her fears&mdash;in B.C. 387&mdash;the
      agreement known as &ldquo;the Peace of Antalcidas.&rdquo; Persia owed to her
      Phoenician subjects the glory of recovering complete possession of Asia
      Minor, and of being accepted as a sort of final arbiter in the quarrels of
      the Grecian states. From B.C. 465 to B.C. 392 Phoenicia served Persia with
      rare fidelity, never hesitating to lend her aid, and never showing the
      least inclination to revolt.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was probably under these circumstances, when Athens owed the recovery
      of her greatness in no small measure to the Phoenicians, that those
      relations of friendship and intimacy were established between the two
      peoples of which we have evidence in several inscriptions. Phoenicians
      settled in Attica, particularly at Phalerum and the Piræus, and had their
      own places of worship and interment. Six sepulchral inscriptions have been
      found, either in Athens itself or at the Piræus,<a href="#linknote-14316"       name="linknoteref-14316" id="linknoteref-14316">14316</a> five of them
      bilingual,<a href="#linknote-14317" name="linknoteref-14317"       id="linknoteref-14317">14317</a> which mark the interment in Attic soil of
      persons whose nationality was Phoenician. They had monuments erected over
      them, generally of some pretension, which must have obtained as much
      respect as the native tombstones, since otherwise they could not have
      endured to our day. There is also at the Piræus an altar,<a
      href="#linknote-14318" name="linknoteref-14318" id="linknoteref-14318">14318</a>
      which a Phoenician must have erected and dedicated to a Phoenician god,
      whom he worshipped on Attic soil apparently without let or hindrance. The
      god&rsquo;s name is given as &ldquo;Askum-Adar,&rdquo; a form which does not elsewhere
      recur, but which is thought to designate the god elsewhere called Sakon,
      who corresponded to the Grecian Hermes.<a href="#linknote-14319"       name="linknoteref-14319" id="linknoteref-14319">14319</a> Moreover, there
      is evidence of the Phoenicians having worshipped two other deities in
      their Attic abodes, one a god who corresponded to the Greek Poseidon and
      the Roman Neptune, the other the Babylonian and Assyrian Nergal. Among the
      lost orations of Deniarchus was one delivered by that orator on the
      occasion of the suit between the people of Phalerum and the Phoenician
      inhabitants of the place with respect to the priesthood of Poseidon;<a
      href="#linknote-14320" name="linknoteref-14320" id="linknoteref-14320">14320</a>
      and a sepulchral monument at the Piræus was erected to Asepta, daughter of
      Esmun-sillem, of Sidon, by Itten-bel, son of Esmun-sibbeh, high priest of
      the god Nergal.<a href="#linknote-14321" name="linknoteref-14321"       id="linknoteref-14321">14321</a> It appears further from the Greek
      inscription, edited by Böckh,<a href="#linknote-14322"       name="linknoteref-14322" id="linknoteref-14322">14322</a> that about this
      time (B.C. 390-370) a decree was promulgated by the Council {bonle} of
      Athens whereby the relation of Proxenia was established between Strato
      (Abd-astartus), king of Sidon, and the Athenian people, and all Sidonians
      sojourning in Attica were exempted from the tax usually charged upon
      foreign settlers, from the obligation of the Choregia, and from all other
      contributions to the state.
    </p>
    <p>
      The power of Persia began about this time to decline, and the Phoenicians
      seem to have wavered in their allegiance. In B.C. 406 or 405 Egypt shook
      off the Persian yoke, and established her independence under a native
      sovereign.<a href="#linknote-14323" name="linknoteref-14323"       id="linknoteref-14323">14323</a> Soon afterwards, probably in B.C. 392 or
      391, Evagoras, a Cypriot Greek, who claimed descent from Teucer,
      inaugurated a revolution at Salamis in Cyprus, where he slew the
      Phoenician monarch, Abdemon, who held his throne under Persia, and,
      himself mounting the throne, proceeded to reduce to subjection the whole
      island.<a href="#linknote-14324" name="linknoteref-14324"       id="linknoteref-14324">14324</a> Vast efforts were made to crush him, but
      for ten years he defied the power of Persia, and maintained himself as an
      independent monarch.<a href="#linknote-14325" name="linknoteref-14325"       id="linknoteref-14325">14325</a> Even when finally he made his submission,
      it was under an express stipulation that he should retain his royal
      dignity, and be simply bound to pay his tribute regularly, and to render
      such obedience as subject kings commonly paid to their suzerain.<a
      href="#linknote-14326" name="linknoteref-14326" id="linknoteref-14326">14326</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of his resistance to Persia, it is beyond question that
      Evagoras received a certain amount of support from Phoenicia; but the
      circumstances under which the support was given was doubtful. According to
      Isocrates,<a href="#linknote-14327" name="linknoteref-14327"       id="linknoteref-14327">14327</a> he equipped a large fleet, and attacked
      the Phoenicians on the mainland with so much vigour as even to take the
      great city of Tyre by assault; but Diodorus says nothing of the attack,
      and it is conjectured that the contagion of revolt, which certainly
      affected, more or less, Cyprus, Cilicia, Caria, and some of the Syrian
      Arabs,<a href="#linknote-14328" name="linknoteref-14328"       id="linknoteref-14328">14328</a> spread also thus early to Phoenicia, and
      that &ldquo;the surrender of Tyre was a voluntary defection."<a
      href="#linknote-14329" name="linknoteref-14329" id="linknoteref-14329">14329</a>
      In that case, we must view Phoenicia, or at any rate a portion of it, as
      having detached itself from Persia, about B.C. 390, sixty years before the
      final break-up of the Empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the disaffection of Phoenicia does not become open and patent until
      about thirty years later. The decline of Persia had continued. In B.C. 375
      an attempt to recover Egypt, for which a vast armament had been collected
      under Pharnabazus and Iphicrates, completely failed.<a
      href="#linknote-14330" name="linknoteref-14330" id="linknoteref-14330">14330</a>
      Nine years afterwards, in B.C. 366, the revolt of the satraps began. First
      Ariobarzanes, satrap of Phrygia, renounced his allegiance, and defended
      himself with success against Autophradutes, satrap of Lydia, and Mausolus,
      native king of Caria under Persia. Then Aspis, who held a part of
      Cappadocia, revolted and maintained himself by the help of the Pisidians,
      until he was overpowered by Datames. Next Datames himself, satrap of the
      rest of Cappadocia, understanding that the mind of the Persian king was
      poisoned against him, made a treaty with Ariobarzanes, and assumed an
      independent attitude in his own province. Finally, in B.C. 362, there
      seems to have been something like a general revolt of the western
      provinces, in which the satraps of Mysia, Phrygia, and Lydia, Mausolus
      prince of Caria, and the peoples of Lycia, Pisidia, Pamphylia, Cilicia,
      and Syria participated.<a href="#linknote-14331" name="linknoteref-14331"       id="linknoteref-14331">14331</a> Then, if not earlier, Phoenicia openly
      threw in her lot with the disaffected;<a href="#linknote-14332"       name="linknoteref-14332" id="linknoteref-14332">14332</a> refused her
      tribute like the others, and joined her forces with theirs. Nor, when the
      rebellion collapsed, did she at once return to her allegiance. When
      Tachos, native king of Egypt, in B.C. 361, having secured the services of
      Agesilaus and Chabrias, advanced boldly into Syria, with the object of
      enlarging his own dominions at the expense of Persia, he was received with
      favour by the Phoenicians, who were quite willing to form a portion of his
      empire. But the rebellion of Nectanebo forced Tachos to relinquish his
      projects,<a href="#linknote-14333" name="linknoteref-14333"       id="linknoteref-14333">14333</a> and the dominion over the Phoenician
      cities seems to have reverted to Persia without any effort on her part.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this condition matters remained till about the year B.C. 351, when
      Sidon, feeling herself aggrieved by the conduct of the Persian authorities
      at Tripolis,<a href="#linknote-14334" name="linknoteref-14334"       id="linknoteref-14334">14334</a> where the general assembly of the
      Phoenicians held its meetings, boldly raised the standard of revolt
      against Persia under Tennes, or Tabnit II., and induced the Phoenicians
      generally to declare themselves independent. Alliance was at once formed
      with the Egyptian king, Nekht-nebf, or Nectanebo II., who sent a body of
      4,000 Greek mercenaries, under Mentor the Rhodian, to the aid of Tennes.<a
      href="#linknote-14335" name="linknoteref-14335" id="linknoteref-14335">14335</a>
      Hostilities commenced by the Phoenicians expelling or massacring the
      Persian garrisons, devastating the royal park or paradise, and burning the
      stores of forage collected for the use of the Persian cavalry.<a
      href="#linknote-14336" name="linknoteref-14336" id="linknoteref-14336">14336</a>
      An attempt made by two satraps&mdash;Belesys of Syria and Mazæus of
      Cilicia&mdash;to crush the revolt was completely defeated by Tennes, with
      the aid of Mentor and his Greeks, who gained a decisive victory over the
      satraps, and drove the Persians out of Phoenicia.<a href="#linknote-14337"       name="linknoteref-14337" id="linknoteref-14337">14337</a> Cyprus then
      joined the rebels. The nine principal cities made common cause, expelled
      the Persians, and declared themselves free states, under their respective
      native kings.<a href="#linknote-14338" name="linknoteref-14338"       id="linknoteref-14338">14338</a> Ochus, the Persian king, was at last
      roused to exert himself. Collecting an army of 300,000 foot and 30,000
      horse, supported by 300 triremes and 500 transports or provision-ships,<a
      href="#linknote-14339" name="linknoteref-14339" id="linknoteref-14339">14339</a>
      he proceeded to the west in person, determined to inflict condign
      punishment on the rebels, and to recover to the empire, not only Cyprus
      and Phoenicia, but also the long-lost Egypt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tennes, on his part, had done his best in the way of preparations for
      defence. He had collected a fleet of above a hundred ships&mdash;triremes
      and quinqueremes,<a href="#linknote-14340" name="linknoteref-14340"       id="linknoteref-14340">14340</a> the latter now heard of for the first
      time in Asiatic warfare. He had strengthened the fortifications of Sidon,
      surrounding the town with a triple ditch of great width and depth, and
      considerably raising the height of the walls.<a href="#linknote-14341"       name="linknoteref-14341" id="linknoteref-14341">14341</a> He had hired
      Greek mercenaries to the number of six thousand, raising thus the number
      in his service to ten thousand in all, had armed and drilled the most
      active and athletic of the citizens, and had collected vast stores of
      provisions, armour, and weapons. But the advance of the Persian monarch at
      the head of so large a force filled Tennes with dismay and despair.
      Successful resistance was, he thought, impossible; and with a selfishness
      and a cowardice that must ever make him rank among the most infamous of
      men, he resolved, if possible, to purchase his own pardon of the King by
      delivering to his vengeance the entire body of his fellow-countrymen.
      Accordingly, after handing over to him a hundred of the principal
      citizens, who were immediately transfixed with javelins, he concerted
      measures with Mentor for receiving the Persians within the walls. While
      the arrangements were proceeding, five hundred of the remaining citizens
      issued forth from one of the gates of the town, with boughs of
      supplication, as a deputation to implore the mercy of Ochus, but only to
      suffer the same fate as their fellow-townsmen. The Persians were then
      received within the walls; but the citizens, understanding what their fate
      was to be, resolved to anticipate it. They had already burnt their ships,
      to prevent any desertion. Now they shut themselves up, with their wives
      and children, in their houses, and applying the torch to their dwellings
      lighted up a general conflagration. More than forty thousand persons
      perished in the flames. Ochus sold the ruins at a high price to
      speculators, who calculated on reimbursing themselves by the treasures
      which they might dig out from among the ashes. As for Tennes, it is
      satisfactory to find that a just vengeance overtook him. The treachery
      which he had employed towards others was shown also to himself. Ochus, who
      had given him a solemn promise that he would spare his life, no sooner
      found that there was nothing more to be gained by letting him live, than
      he relentlessly put him to death.<a href="#linknote-14342"       name="linknoteref-14342" id="linknoteref-14342">14342</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      No further resistance was made by the Phoenician cities. Ochus marched on
      against Egypt and effected its reconquest.<a href="#linknote-14343"       name="linknoteref-14343" id="linknoteref-14343">14343</a> The Cyprian
      revolt was put down by the Prince of Caria, Istricus.<a
      href="#linknote-14344" name="linknoteref-14344" id="linknoteref-14344">14344</a>
      A calm, prelude to the coming storm, settled down upon Persia; and
      Phoenicia participated in the general tranquillity. The various
      communities, exhausted by their recent efforts, and disappointed with the
      result, laid aside their political aspirations, and fell back upon their
      commercial instincts. Trade once more flourished. Sidon rose again from
      her ashes, and recovered a certain amount of prosperity. She held the
      coast from Leontopolis to Ornithonpolis, and possessed also the dependency
      of Dor;<a href="#linknote-14345" name="linknoteref-14345"       id="linknoteref-14345">14345</a> but she had lost Sarepta to Tyre,<a
      href="#linknote-14346" name="linknoteref-14346" id="linknoteref-14346">14346</a>
      which stepped into the foremost place among the cities on her fall, and
      retained it until destroyed by Alexander. The other towns which still
      continued to be of some importance were Aradus, and Gebal or Byblus. These
      cities, like Tyre and Sidon, retained their native kings,<a
      href="#linknote-14347" name="linknoteref-14347" id="linknoteref-14347">14347</a>
      who ruled their several states with little interference from the Persians.
      The line of monarchs may be traced at Sidon for five generations, from the
      first Esmunazar, who probably reigned about B.C. 460-440, through three
      generations and four kings, to the second Strato, the contemporary of
      Alexander.<a href="#linknote-14348" name="linknoteref-14348"       id="linknoteref-14348">14348</a> The first Esmunazar was succeeded by his
      son, Tabnit, about B.C. 440. Tabnit married his sister, Am-Ashtoreth,
      priestess of Ashtoreth, and had issue, two sons, Esmunazar II., whose tomb
      was found near Sidon by M. de Vogüé in the year 1855, and Strato I.
      Esmunazar II. is thought to have died about B.C. 400, and to have been
      succeeded by his brother Strato, the Proxenus of Athens, who reigned till

    <p>
      The invasion of Asia by Alexander the Great, though it found the Persians
      unready, was by no means of the nature of a surprise. The design had been
      openly proclaimed by Philip in the year B.C. 338, when he forced the
      Grecian States to appoint him generalissimo of their armies, which he
      promised to lead to the conquest of the East.<a href="#linknote-14350"       name="linknoteref-14350" id="linknoteref-14350">14350</a> Darius
      Codomannus had thus ample warning of what he had to expect, and abundant
      opportunity to make the fullest preparations for defence. During the years
      B.C. 338 and 337, while Philip was still alive, he did do something
      towards organising defensive measures, collected troops and ships, and
      tried to foment discontent and encourage anti-Macedonian movements in
      Greece.<a href="#linknote-14351" name="linknoteref-14351"       id="linknoteref-14351">14351</a> But the death of Philip by the dagger of
      Pausanias caused him most imprudently to relax his efforts, to consider
      the danger past, and to suspend the operations, which he had commenced,
      until he should see whether Alexander had either the will or the power to
      carry into effect his father&rsquo;s projects. The events of the years B.C. 336
      and 335, the successes of Alexander in Thrace, Illyria, and Boeotia,<a
      href="#linknote-14352" name="linknoteref-14352" id="linknoteref-14352">14352</a>
      woke him from his fool&rsquo;s paradise to some sense of the realities of the
      situation. In B.C. 335 the preparations for defence were resumed. Orders
      were issued to the satraps of Phrygia and Lydia to draw together their
      troops towards the north-western corner of Asia Minor, and to take the
      offensive against the Macedonian force which had crossed the straits
      before Philip&rsquo;s death. The Persian garrisons in this quarter were strongly
      reinforced with troops of a good quality, drawn from the remoter provinces
      of the empire, as from Persia Proper, Media, Hyrcania, and Bactria. Notice
      was given to the Phoenicians to prepare a considerable fleet, and hold it
      in readiness for active service. Above all, Memnon the Rhodian was given a
      command on the Asiatic seaboard, and entrusted with a body of five
      thousand Greek mercenaries, which he was empowered to use at his
      discretion.<a href="#linknote-14353" name="linknoteref-14353"       id="linknoteref-14353">14353</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      But these steps, though in the right direction, were quite inadequate
      under the circumstances. Everything that was possible should have been
      done to prevent Alexander from crossing to Asia in force. The fleet should
      not only have been commanded to hold itself in readiness, but should have
      been brought up. Four hundred or five hundred vessels,<a
      href="#linknote-14354" name="linknoteref-14354" id="linknoteref-14354">14354</a>
      from Phoenicia, Cyprus, Egypt, Lycia, and Cilicia, should have been moved
      into the northern Egean and the Propontis, and have kept watch on every
      Grecian port. Alexander was unable to muster for the transport of his army
      across the Straits a larger number than 160 triremes.<a
      href="#linknote-14355" name="linknoteref-14355" id="linknoteref-14355">14355</a>
      Persia should have met them with a fleet three times as large. Had Memnon
      been given from the first a free hand at sea, instead of satrapial power
      on land, it is quite conceivable that the invasion of Asia by Alexander
      might have proved as abortive an enterprise as the contemplated invasion
      of England by Napoleon.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it was, the fleet of Persia, composed mainly of Phoenician vessels, did
      not appear in the northern Egean waters until some weeks after Alexander
      had transported his grand army into Asia, and fought at the Granicus, so
      that when it arrived it was of comparatively little service. Too late even
      to save Miletus, it had to be a tame spectator of the siege and capture of
      that important town.<a href="#linknote-14356" name="linknoteref-14356"       id="linknoteref-14356">14356</a> It was then withdrawn to Halicarnassus,
      where its presence greatly helped the defence, but not to the extent of
      wholly baffling the besiegers. Halicarnassus fell, like Miletus, after a
      while, being entered from the land side; but the fleet saved the troops,
      the stores, and the inhabitants.<a href="#linknote-14357"       name="linknoteref-14357" id="linknoteref-14357">14357</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      During the early part of the ensuing year, B.C. 333, while Alexander was
      engaged in conquering the interior of Asia Minor, the Persian fleet under
      Memnon at last took the aggressive, and, advancing northwards, employed
      itself in establishing Persian influence over the whole of the Egean, and
      especially in reducing the important islands of Chios and Lesbos.<a
      href="#linknote-14358" name="linknoteref-14358" id="linknoteref-14358">14358</a>
      Memnon was now in full command. Fortune smiled on him; and it seemed more
      than probable that the war would be, at least partially, transferred into
      Greece, where the Spartans only waited for Memnon&rsquo;s appearance to commence
      an anti-Macedonian movement. The presence of a powerful fleet in Greek
      waters, and Memnon&rsquo;s almost unlimited command of Persian gold, might in a
      short time have raised such a flame in Greece as to necessitate
      Alexander&rsquo;s return in order to extinguish it.<a href="#linknote-14359"       name="linknoteref-14359" id="linknoteref-14359">14359</a> The invasion of
      Asia might have been arrested in mid course; Alexander might have proved
      as powerless as Agesilaus to effect any great change in the relations of
      the two continents; but, at the critical moment, the sudden and unexpected
      death of the Rhodian chief cast all these hopes to the ground,<a
      href="#linknote-14360" name="linknoteref-14360" id="linknoteref-14360">14360</a>
      and deprived Persia of her last chance of baffling the invader.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, first by mismanagement and then by an unhappy accident, the
      Phoenicians were precluded from rendering Persia any effective service in
      the time of her great necessity. Wiser than Napoleon, Alexander would not
      contest the sovereignty of the seas with the great naval power of the day,
      and he even, when he once felt himself strongly lodged in Asia, disbanded
      his naval force,<a href="#linknote-14361" name="linknoteref-14361"       id="linknoteref-14361">14361</a> that so it might be impossible for
      disaster at sea to tarnish his prestige. He was convinced that Asia could
      be won by the land force which he had been permitted to disembark on its
      shores, and probably anticipated the transfer of naval supremacy which
      almost immediately followed on the victory of Issus. The complete defeat
      of the great army of Codomannus, and its retirement on the Euphrates,<a
      href="#linknote-14362" name="linknoteref-14362" id="linknoteref-14362">14362</a>
      left the entire seaboard of Syria and Phoenicia open to him. He resolved
      at once to take advantage of the opportunity, and to detach from Persia
      the three countries of Phoenicia, Egypt, and Cyprus. If he could transfer
      to himself the navies of these powers, his maritime supremacy would be
      incontestable. He would render his communications with Macedonia
      absolutely secure. He would have nothing to fear from revolt or
      disturbance at home, however deeply he might plunge into the Asiatic
      continent. If the worst happened to him in Asia, he would have assured
      himself a safe return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, no sooner was the retreat of Darius upon the line of the
      Euphrates, and his abandonment of Syria, ascertained, than Alexander,
      after despatching a detachment of his army to Damascus, marched in person
      into Phoenicia.<a href="#linknote-14363" name="linknoteref-14363"       id="linknoteref-14363">14363</a> The Phoenicians were placed between two
      dangers. On the one hand, Alexander might ravage their territory, capture
      and pillage their cities, massacre or sell for slaves the greater portion
      of their citizens, and destroy their very existence as a people; on the
      other hand, Darius held as hostages for their fidelity the crews and
      captains of their triremes, which formed a portion of his fleet, and had
      on board a large number of their chief men, and even some of their kings.<a
      href="#linknote-14364" name="linknoteref-14364" id="linknoteref-14364">14364</a>
      It was impossible, however, to temporise; a choice had necessarily to be
      made; and when Alexander entered Phoenicia, the cities, in almost every
      case, decided on submitting to him. First Strato, the son of Ger-astartus,
      king of Aradus, who was serving on board the Phoenician contingent to the
      Persian fleet, went out to meet Alexander, and surrendered into his hands
      the four cities of Aradus, Marathus, Sigon, and Mariamme.<a
      href="#linknote-14365" name="linknoteref-14365" id="linknoteref-14365">14365</a>
      Then Byblus, whose king was also absent with the fleet, opened its gates
      to the Macedonians.<a href="#linknote-14366" name="linknoteref-14366"       id="linknoteref-14366">14366</a> Next Sidon, mindful of her recent wrongs,
      sent envoys to invite Alexander&rsquo;s approach, and joyfully embraced his
      cause.<a href="#linknote-14367" name="linknoteref-14367"       id="linknoteref-14367">14367</a> Even Tyre nominally made submission, and
      declared itself ready to obey Alexander&rsquo;s commands;<a
      href="#linknote-14368" name="linknoteref-14368" id="linknoteref-14368">14368</a>
      and the transfer of Phoenicia to the side of Alexander might have been
      made without bloodshed, had the Macedonian monarch been content to leave
      their island city, which was their true capital, and their pride and
      glory, unmolested. But Alexander could not brook anything that in any
      degree savoured of opposition to his will. When therefore, on his
      expressing a wish to sacrifice to Melkarth in their island town, the
      Tyrians declined to receive him within the walls, and suggested that his
      pious design might be sufficiently accomplished by his making his intended
      offering in Palæ-Tyrus, where there was a temple of the same god, which
      was older (they said) and more venerable than their own, Alexander&rsquo;s pride
      was touched, and he became violently enraged.<a href="#linknote-14369"       name="linknoteref-14369" id="linknoteref-14369">14369</a> Dismissing the
      envoys with angry threats, he at once began preparations for an attack
      upon the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Tyrians have been accused of extreme rashness and folly in not making
      an unqualified submission to the demands preferred by Alexander,<a
      href="#linknote-14370" name="linknoteref-14370" id="linknoteref-14370">14370</a>
      but the reproach scarcely appears to be deserved. They had on previous
      occasions resisted for years the entire power of Assyria, and of Babylon;
      they naturally deemed themselves only assailable by sea; their
      fortifications were of immense strength; and they possessed a navy much
      superior to any of which Alexander could boast at the time when he
      threatened them. Their own vessels were eighty in number; those of their
      kinsmen upon the continent were likewise eighty; Cyprus, which for
      centuries had been closely allied with them, and which was more than half
      Phoenician in blood, could furnish a hundred and twenty; Carthage, if she
      chose, could send to their aid, without any difficulty, as many as two
      hundred.<a href="#linknote-14371" name="linknoteref-14371"       id="linknoteref-14371">14371</a> Alexander had never been able to collect
      from the Greek states which owned his sway a fleet of more than one
      hundred and sixty sail; and, having disbanded this fleet, he could not
      readily have mustered from the cities and countries accessible to him,
      exclusive of Cyprus and Phoenicia, so many as a hundred.<a
      href="#linknote-14372" name="linknoteref-14372" id="linknoteref-14372">14372</a>
      The Tyrians, when they took their resolution to oppose Alexander, had a
      right to expect that their kindred would either assist them, or at any
      rate not serve against them, and that thus they would be sure to maintain
      their supremacy at sea. As for Alexander&rsquo;s design to join the island Tyre
      to the continent by means of a mole, they cannot have had the slightest
      suspicion of it, since no work of the kind had ever previously been
      accomplished, or even attempted; for the demonstration of Xerxes against
      Salamis was not seriously intended.<a href="#linknote-14373"       name="linknoteref-14373" id="linknoteref-14373">14373</a> They naturally
      counted on the struggle being entirely by sea, and may well have thought
      that on their own element they would not be worsted. Even if the
      continental towns forsook them and went over to the enemy, why might they
      not do as they had done in Shalmaneser&rsquo;s time, defeat their unnatural
      countrymen, and retain their naval supremacy? Moreover, if they made a
      gallant fight, might not Persia be expected to second their efforts? Would
      she not attack Alexander from the flanks of Lebanon, intercept his
      supplies, cut off his foragers, and make his position untenable; the
      Tyrians could scarcely anticipate that Persia would sit with folded hands,
      a calm spectator of a seven months&rsquo; siege, and do absolutely nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having determined on resistance to the demands of Alexander, the Tyrians
      lost no time in placing their city in a position to resist attack. They
      summoned their king, Azemilcus, from the Persian fleet, and required him
      to hasten home with the entire squadron which he commanded.<a
      href="#linknote-14374" name="linknoteref-14374" id="linknoteref-14374">14374</a>
      They collected triremes and lighter vessels from various quarters. They
      distributed along the walls of the city upon every side a number of
      engines of war, constructed to hurl darts and stones, and amply provided
      them with missiles.<a href="#linknote-14375" name="linknoteref-14375"       id="linknoteref-14375">14375</a> The skilled workmen and engineers
      resident in the town were called upon not merely to furnish additional
      engines of the old type, but to exercise their ingenuity in devising new
      and unheard of structures.<a href="#linknote-14376"       name="linknoteref-14376" id="linknoteref-14376">14376</a> They armed all
      the young and vigorous among the people, and appointed them their several
      stations at the walls. Finally, to diminish the number of mouths to be
      fed, and to save themselves from distracting cares, they sent away to
      Carthage a number of their aged men, their women, and their children, who
      were readily received and supported by the rich and friendly colonists.<a
      href="#linknote-14377" name="linknoteref-14377" id="linknoteref-14377">14377</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Alexander had taken his resolution. Either recollecting what
      Xerxes had threatened to do at Salamis, or prompted merely by his own
      inventive genius, he determined on the construction of a great mole, or
      embankment, which should be carried out from the Asiatic mainland across
      the half-mile of channel to the very walls of the recalcitrant city, and
      should thus join the island to the Syrian shore. The width of the
      embankment he fixed at two plethra, or nearly seventy yards.<a
      href="#linknote-14378" name="linknoteref-14378" id="linknoteref-14378">14378</a>
      Material for the construction was abundant. The great city of Palæ-Tyrus
      was close at hand, partly in ruins, and with many of the houses deserted
      by their inhabitants. Its walls would furnish abundance of stone, mortar,
      and rubble. Behind Palæ-Tyrus lay the flanks of Lebanon, cultivated in
      orchards, while beyond were its dense and inexhaustible forests of fir,
      pine, and cedar. Human labour could be obtained to almost any extent, for
      the neighbourhood was populous, and Alexander&rsquo;s authority acknowledged by
      all. Accordingly the work, once commenced, for a while made fair progress.
      Piles were cut in the mountain, which were driven with much ease into the
      soft mud of the channel, which was shallow near the shore,<a
      href="#linknote-14379" name="linknoteref-14379" id="linknoteref-14379">14379</a>
      and completely under the control of the Macedonians, since the Tyrian
      vessels could not approach it for fear of sticking in the ooze. Between
      the piles, towards the edge of the mole, were sunk stones, trunks of
      trees, and material of the more solid character, while the central part
      was filled up with rubble and rubbish of every sort and kind. Still, the
      operation was toilsome and tedious, even from the first, while the further
      that the mole was advanced into the sea, the more difficult and dangerous
      became its construction. The channel deepened gradually from a few feet
      towards the shore to eighteen or twenty,<a href="#linknote-14380"       name="linknoteref-14380" id="linknoteref-14380">14380</a> as it approached
      the island. The Tyrians in their vessels were soon able to act. In small
      boats at first, and afterwards in their triremes, they attacked and
      annoyed the workmen, perpetually hindered their work, and occasionally
      destroyed portions of it.<a href="#linknote-14381" name="linknoteref-14381"       id="linknoteref-14381">14381</a> Damage was also inflicted by the wind and
      waves; and the rate of progress became, in consequence, exceedingly slow.
      A strong current set through the channel, and this was continually working
      its way among the interstices of the mole, washing holes in its sides and
      face, and loosening the interior of the structure. When a storm arose, the
      surf broke over the top of the work, and did even greater damage, carrying
      portions of the outer casing into the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      To meet the assaults of the Tyrian ships upon the work, the Macedonians
      constructed two movable towers, well protected against torches and weapons
      by curtains made of raw hides,<a href="#linknote-14382"       name="linknoteref-14382" id="linknoteref-14382">14382</a> and advancing
      these upon the surface of the mole to the points most threatened,
      discharged from the engines which the towers contained darts and stones of
      a large size against the Tyrian sailors. Thus protected, the workmen were
      able to make sensible progress, and the Tyrians began to fear that, unless
      they could destroy the towers, the mole would ere long be completed. For
      the accomplishment of their purpose, they resolved to employ a fire-ship.<a
      href="#linknote-14383" name="linknoteref-14383" id="linknoteref-14383">14383</a>
      Selecting one of the largest of their horse-transports, they stowed the
      hold with dry brushwood and other combustible materials; and erecting on
      the prow two masters, each with a projecting arm, attached to either a
      cauldron, filled with bitumen and sulphur, and with every sort of material
      apt to kindle and nourish flame. By loading the stern of the transport
      with stones of a large size, they succeeded in depressing it and
      correspondingly elevating the prow, which was thus prepared to glide over
      the smooth surface of the mole and bring itself into contact with the
      towers. In the fore part of the ship were deposited a quantity of torches,
      resin, and other combustibles. Watching an opportunity when the wind blew
      strongly from the seaward straight upon the mole, they towed the vessel at
      their best speed in the direction of the towers, set it on fire, and then,
      loosing their hawsers, allowed it to dash itself upon the work. The prow
      slid over the top a certain distance and then stopped. The arms projecting
      from the masts broke off at the sudden check,<a href="#linknote-14384"       name="linknoteref-14384" id="linknoteref-14384">14384</a> and scattered
      the contents of the cauldrons around. The towers caught fire and were at
      once in a blaze. The Macedonians found it impossible to extinguish the
      flames, since the Tyrian triremes, drawing close to the mole, prevented
      approach by flights of arrows and other missiles. &ldquo;At the same time, the
      full naval force of the city, both ships and little boats, was sent forth
      to land men at once on all parts of the mole. So successful was this
      attack, that all the Macedonian engines were burnt&mdash;the outer
      woodwork which kept the mole together was torn up in many places&mdash;and
      a large part of the structure came to pieces."<a href="#linknote-14385"       name="linknoteref-14385" id="linknoteref-14385">14385</a> A heavy sea,
      moreover, accompanied the gale of wind which had favoured the
      conflagration, and penetrating the loosened work, carried the whole into
      deep waters.<a href="#linknote-14386" name="linknoteref-14386"       id="linknoteref-14386">14386</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander had now seriously to consider what course he should take.
      Hitherto his attempt had proved an entire failure. Should he relinquish
      it? To do so would be to acknowledge himself baffled and defeated, to
      tarnish the prestige which he held so dear, and to cripple the plans that
      he had formed against Persia. It was simply impossible that Alexander,
      being the man he was, should so act. No&mdash;he must persevere&mdash;he
      must confront and overcome his difficulties&mdash;he must repair the
      damages that he had suffered, restore his lost works, and carry them out
      on a larger scale, and with more skill than before. He gave orders
      therefore for an enlargement and alteration of the mole, which he no
      longer carried across the strait in a direct line, but inclined to the
      south-west,<a href="#linknote-14387" name="linknoteref-14387"       id="linknoteref-14387">14387</a> so that it might meet the force of the
      prevalent wind, instead of exposing its flank to the violent gusts. He
      also commanded the construction of fresh towers and fresh engines,
      stronger and more in number than the former ones.<a href="#linknote-14388"       name="linknoteref-14388" id="linknoteref-14388">14388</a> But this alone
      would not, he felt, be enough. His designs had been frustrated hitherto
      solely from the fact that the Tyrians were masters of the sea; and it was
      plain to him that, so long as this state of things remained unaltered, it
      was next to impossible that he should succeed. The great desideratum&mdash;the
      one condition of success&mdash;was the possession of a powerful fleet.
      Such a fleet must be either built or collected. Leaving therefore the
      restoration of the mole and the engines to his generals, Alexander went in
      person to Sidon, and there set himself to gather together as large a fleet
      as he could. Most opportunely it happened that, either shortly before
      Alexander&rsquo;s arrival or immediately afterwards, the ships of Sidon, Aradus,
      and Byblus, which had been serving with the Persian naval force in the
      Ægean, had been required by their respective commanders to proceed
      homewards, and, to the number of eighty, had sailed into the harbour of
      Sidon.<a href="#linknote-14389" name="linknoteref-14389"       id="linknoteref-14389">14389</a> The kings had, in fact, deserted the
      Persian cause on hearing that their cities had submitted to Alexander, and
      readily placed their respective squadrons at his disposal. Further
      contingents were received from other quarters&mdash;from Rhodes ten
      triremes, from the seaports of Lycia the same number, from Soli and Mallus
      three, from Macedonia a single penteconter.<a href="#linknote-14390"       name="linknoteref-14390" id="linknoteref-14390">14390</a> The number of
      the vessels was thus brought up to one hundred and four; but even with
      such a fleet it would have been rash to engage the Tyrian navy; and
      Alexander would probably have had to build an additional squadron had he
      not received, suddenly and unexpectedly, the adhesion of the princes of
      Cyprus. Cyprus, being an island, was as yet in no danger, and might have
      been expected at least to remain neutral until the fate of Tyre was
      decided; but, for reasons that history has not recorded, the petty kings
      of the island about this time&mdash;some months after the battle of Issus&mdash;resolved
      to desert Persia, to detach themselves wholly from Tyre, and to place
      their navy at the disposal of the Macedonians.<a href="#linknote-14391"       name="linknoteref-14391" id="linknoteref-14391">14391</a> The number of
      their triremes amounted to 120; and Alexander, having now under his
      command a fleet of 224 sail, could no longer feel any doubt of being able
      to wrest the supremacy at sea from the unfortunate Tyrians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, after allowing his ships a period of eleven days for nautical
      practice, and placing on board a number of his bravest soldiers,<a
      href="#linknote-14392" name="linknoteref-14392" id="linknoteref-14392">14392</a>
      Alexander sailed out from Sidon at the head of his entire fleet, and made
      straight for Tyre in order of battle. He himself in person commanded the
      right wing, the post of danger, since it held the open sea, and had under
      him the bulk of the Cyprian ships, with their commanders. Pnytagoras of
      Salamis and Craterus led the left wing, which was composed mainly of the
      vessels furnished by the Phoenician towns upon the mainland, and held its
      course at no great distance from the shore. The Tyrians, who had received
      no intelligence from without, saw with astonishment the great fleet,
      nearly three times as large as their own,<a href="#linknote-14393"       name="linknoteref-14393" id="linknoteref-14393">14393</a> bearing down
      upon them in orderly array, and challenging them to the combat. They had
      not now the spirit of ancient times, when no disparity of force dismayed
      them. Surprised and alarmed, they resolved to decline a battle, to remain
      within their ports, and to use their ships for blocking the entrances.
      Alexander, advancing from the north, when he saw the mouth of the Sidonian
      harbour, which faced northwards, strongly guarded, did not attempt to
      force it, but anchored his vessels outside, and established a blockade,
      the maintenance of which he entrusted to the Cyprian squadron. The next
      day he ordered the Phoenician ships to proceed southwards, and similarly
      block and watch the southern or Egyptian harbour.<a href="#linknote-14394"       name="linknoteref-14394" id="linknoteref-14394">14394</a> For himself, he
      landed upon the mole, and pitching his tent near the south-western corner,
      there established himself.<a href="#linknote-14395"       name="linknoteref-14395" id="linknoteref-14395">14395</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The mole had not advanced very much during his absence. Vast efforts had
      been made to re-establish it, but they had not been attended with any
      great success.<a href="#linknote-14396" name="linknoteref-14396"       id="linknoteref-14396">14396</a> Whole trees, torn up by the roots, and
      with their branches still adhering to them, had been dragged to the
      water&rsquo;s edge, and then precipitated into the strait;<a
      href="#linknote-14397" name="linknoteref-14397" id="linknoteref-14397">14397</a>
      a layer of stones and mud had been placed upon them, to solidify them into
      a mass; on the top of this other trees had been placed, and the former
      process repeated. But the Tyrians had met the new tactics with new
      methods. They had employed divers to attach hooks to the boughs where they
      projected into the sea, and by sheer force had dragged the trees out from
      the superincumbent mass, bringing down in this way large portions of the
      structure.<a href="#linknote-14398" name="linknoteref-14398"       id="linknoteref-14398">14398</a> But with Alexander&rsquo;s coming, and the
      retirement of the Tyrian fleet, all this was altered. Alexander&rsquo;s workmen
      were no longer impeded, except from the town, and in a short time the mole
      was completed across the channel and carried up to the very foot of the
      defences. The new towers, which had replaced the burnt ones, were brought
      up close to the walls, and plied the new machines which Cyprian and
      Phoenician engineers had constructed for their new master.<a
      href="#linknote-14399" name="linknoteref-14399" id="linknoteref-14399">14399</a>
      The battering of the wall began. Engines moreover of a large size were
      placed on horse-transports furnished by Sidon, and on the heavier and
      clumsier of the triremes, and with these attacks were made upon the town
      in various places, all round the circuit of the walls, which, if they did
      nothing else, served to distract the attention of the defenders. To meet
      such assailants the Tyrians had let down huge blocks of stone into the
      sea, which prevented the approach of the ships, and hindered those on
      board from using the battering ram. These blocks the Macedonians
      endeavoured to weigh up and remove by means of cranes; but their vessels
      were too unsteady for the purpose, whereupon they proceeded to anchor
      them. The Tyrians went out in boats well protected, and passing under the
      stems and sterns of the vessels, cut the cables, whereupon the Macedonians
      kept an armed watch upon the cables in boats of their own, which the
      Tyrians did not venture to attack. They were not, however, without
      resource even yet, since they contrived still to cut the cables by means
      of divers. At last the Macedonians bethought themselves of using chains
      for cables instead of ropes; these could not be cut, and the result was
      that at length they succeeded in dragging the stones away and obtaining
      access to the foot of the walls wherever they pleased.<a
      href="#linknote-14400" name="linknoteref-14400" id="linknoteref-14400">14400</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Under these circumstances, threatened on every side, and feeling almost at
      the last gasp, the Tyrians resolved on a final desperate effort. They
      would make a bold attempt to recover the command of the sea. As the
      Macedonian fleet was divided, part watching the Sidonian and part the
      Egyptian harbour, they could freely select to contend with which portion
      they preferred. Their choice fell upon the Cyprian contingent, which was
      stationed to the north of the mole, keeping guard on the &ldquo;Portus
      Sidonius.&rdquo; This they determined to attack, and to take, if possible, by
      surprise. Long previously they had spread sails along the mouth of the
      harbour, to prevent their proceedings inside it from being overlooked.<a
      href="#linknote-14401" name="linknoteref-14401" id="linknoteref-14401">14401</a>
      They now prepared a select squadron of thirteen ships&mdash;three of them
      quinqueremes, three quadriremes, and seven triremes&mdash;and silently
      placing on board their best sailors and the best and bravest of their
      men-at-arms, waited till the hour of noon, when the Cyprian crews would be
      taking their mid-day meal, and Alexander might be expected, according to
      his general habit, to have retired to his tent on the opposite side of the
      mole. When noon came, still in deep silence, they issued from the harbour
      in single file, each crew rowing gently without noise or splash, or a word
      spoken, either by the boatswains or by anyone else. In this way they came
      almost close to the Cyprians without being perceived: then suddenly the
      boatswains gave out their cry, and the men cheered, and all pulled as hard
      as they could, and with splash and dash they drove their ships against the
      enemy&rsquo;s, which were inert, lying at anchor, some empty, others hurriedly
      taking their crews on board. The ships of three Cyprian kings&mdash;Pnytagoras,
      king of Salamis, Androcles, king of Amathus, and Pasicrates, king of
      Curium<a href="#linknote-14402" name="linknoteref-14402"       id="linknoteref-14402">14402</a>&mdash;were at once run down and sunk.<a
      href="#linknote-14403" name="linknoteref-14403" id="linknoteref-14403">14403</a>
      Many others were disabled; the rest fled, pursued by the Tyrians, and
      sought to reach the shore. All would probably have been lost, had not
      Alexander returned from his tent earlier than usual, and witnessed the
      Tyrian attack. With his usual promptitude, he at once formed his plan. As
      only a portion of the Cyprian fleet had maintained the blockade, while the
      remainder of their ships were lying off the north shore of the mole with
      their crews disembarked, he set to work to man these, and sent them off,
      as each was got ready, to station themselves at the mouth of the harbour,
      and prevent any more of the Tyrian vessels from sallying forth. He then
      hurried to the southern side of the mole, where the Greco-Phoenician
      squadron kept guard, and manning a certain number of the vessels,<a
      href="#linknote-14404" name="linknoteref-14404" id="linknoteref-14404">14404</a>
      sailed with them round the western shore of the island into the northern
      bay, where the Tyrians and the remnant of the Cyprian fleet were still
      contending. Those in the city perceived the movement, and made every
      effort to signal it to their sailors, but in vain. The noise and uproar of
      the battle prevented them from hearing until it was too late. It was not
      till Alexander had entered the northern bay that they understood, and
      turned and fled, pursued by his ships, which captured or disabled the
      greater number. The crews, however, and the men-at-arms, escaped, since
      they threw themselves overboard, and easily swam into the harbour.<a
      href="#linknote-14405" name="linknoteref-14405" id="linknoteref-14405">14405</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the last attempt of the Tyrians by sea. They were now invested on
      every side, and hopelessly shut up within their defences. Still, however,
      they made a desperate resistance. On the side of the mole the Macedonians,
      having brought up their towers and battering-ram close to the wall,
      attacked it with much vigour, hurling against it great masses of stone,
      and by constant flights of darts and arrows driving the defenders from the
      battlements.<a href="#linknote-14406" name="linknoteref-14406"       id="linknoteref-14406">14406</a> At the same time the battering-rams were
      actively plied, and every effort made to effect a breach. But the Tyrians
      deadened the blows of the rams and the force of the stones by letting down
      from the walls leathern bags filled with sea-weed at the points assailed;<a
      href="#linknote-14407" name="linknoteref-14407" id="linknoteref-14407">14407</a>
      while, by wheels which were set in rapid motion, they intercepted the
      darts and javelins wherewith they were attacked, and broke them or
      diverted them from their intended courses.<a href="#linknote-14408"       name="linknoteref-14408" id="linknoteref-14408">14408</a> When
      boarding-bridges were thrown from the towers to the top of the walls, and
      an attempt was made to pass troops into the town across them, they flung
      grappling hooks among the soldiers on the bridges, which caught in their
      bodies and lacerated them, or dragged their shields from their hands, or
      sometimes hauled them bodily into the air, and then dashed them against
      the wall or against the ground.<a href="#linknote-14409"       name="linknoteref-14409" id="linknoteref-14409">14409</a> Further, they
      made ready masses of red-hot metal, and hurled them against the towers and
      the scaling-parties.<a href="#linknote-14410" name="linknoteref-14410"       id="linknoteref-14410">14410</a> They also heated sand over fires and
      poured it from the battlements on all who approached the foot of the wall;
      this, penetrating between the armour and the skin, inflicted such
      intolerable pain that the sufferers were forced to tear off their coats of
      mail, whereupon they were easily transfixed by arrows or long lances.<a
      href="#linknote-14411" name="linknoteref-14411" id="linknoteref-14411">14411</a>
      With scythes they cut the ropes and thongs by means of which the rams were
      worked;<a href="#linknote-14412" name="linknoteref-14412"       id="linknoteref-14412">14412</a> and at last, armed with hatchets, they
      sprang from the battlements upon the Macedonian boarding-bridges, and in a
      hand-to-hand combat defeated and drove back their assailants.<a
      href="#linknote-14413" name="linknoteref-14413" id="linknoteref-14413">14413</a>
      Finally, when, despite of all their efforts, the outer wall began to give
      way, they constructed an inner wall to take its place, broader and
      stronger than the other.<a href="#linknote-14414" name="linknoteref-14414"       id="linknoteref-14414">14414</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander, after a time, became convinced that his endeavours to take the
      city from the mole were hopeless, and turned his attention to the sea
      defences, north and south of the mole, which were far less strong than
      those which he had hitherto been attacking.<a href="#linknote-14415"       name="linknoteref-14415" id="linknoteref-14415">14415</a> He placed his
      best engines and his boarding-bridges upon ships, and proceeded to batter
      the sea walls in various places. On the south side, near the Egyptian
      harbour, he found a weak place, and concentrating his efforts upon it, he
      succeeded in effecting a large breach.<a href="#linknote-14416"       name="linknoteref-14416" id="linknoteref-14416">14416</a> He then gave
      orders for a general assault.<a href="#linknote-14417"       name="linknoteref-14417" id="linknoteref-14417">14417</a> The two fleets
      were commanded to force simultaneously the entrances to the two harbours;
      other vessels to make demonstrations against the walls at all approachable
      points; the army collected on the mole to renew its assaults; while he
      himself, with his trustiest soldiers, delivered the main attack at the
      southern breach.<a href="#linknote-14418" name="linknoteref-14418"       id="linknoteref-14418">14418</a> Two vessels were selected for the
      purpose. On one, which was that of Coenus, he embarked a portion of the
      phalanx; on the other, which was commanded by Admetus, he placed his
      bodyguard, himself accompanying it. The struggle was short when once the
      boarding-bridges were thrown across and rested on the battered wall.
      Fighting under the eye of their king, the Macedonians carried all before
      them, though not without important losses. Admetus himself, who was the
      first to step on to the wall, received a spear thrust, and was slain.<a
      href="#linknote-14419" name="linknoteref-14419" id="linknoteref-14419">14419</a>
      But the soldiers who were following close behind him maintained their
      footing, and in a little time got possession of several towers, with the
      spaces between them. Alexander was among the foremost of those who mounted
      the breach,<a href="#linknote-14420" name="linknoteref-14420"       id="linknoteref-14420">14420</a> and was for a while hotly engaged in a
      hand-to-hand fight with the enemy. When those who resisted him were slain
      or driven off, he directed his troops to seize the royal palace, which
      abutted on the southern wall, and through it make their entrance into the
      town.<a href="#linknote-14421" name="linknoteref-14421"       id="linknoteref-14421">14421</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the Greco-Phoenician fleet on the south side of the mole had
      burst the boom and other obstacles by which the Egyptian harbour was
      closed, and, attacking the ships within, had disabled some, and driven the
      rest ashore, thus gaining possession of the southern port and a ready
      access to the adjacent portion of the city.<a href="#linknote-14422"       name="linknoteref-14422" id="linknoteref-14422">14422</a> The Cyprians,
      moreover, on the north, had forced their way into the Sidonian harbour,
      which had no boom, and obtained an entrance into the town on that quarter.<a
      href="#linknote-14423" name="linknoteref-14423" id="linknoteref-14423">14423</a>
      The defences were broken through in three places, and it might have been
      expected that resistance would have ceased. But the gallant defenders
      still would not yield. A large body assembled at the Agenorium, or temple
      of Agenor, and there made a determined stand, which continued till
      Alexander himself attacked them with his bodyguard, and slew almost the
      entire number. Others, mounting upon the roofs of the houses, flung down
      stones and missiles of all kinds upon the Macedonians in the street. A
      portion shut themselves up in their homes and perished by their own hands.
      In the streets and squares there was a terrible carnage. The Macedonians
      were infuriated by the length of the siege, the stubbornness of the
      resistance, and the fact that the Tyrians had in the course of the siege
      publicly executed, probably by way of sacrifice, a number of their
      prisoners upon the walls. Those who died with arms in their hands are
      reckoned at eight thousand;<a href="#linknote-14424"       name="linknoteref-14424" id="linknoteref-14424">14424</a> two thousand
      more, who had been made prisoners, were barbarously crucified by command
      of Alexander round the walls of the city.<a href="#linknote-14425"       name="linknoteref-14425" id="linknoteref-14425">14425</a> None of the
      adult free males were spared, except the few who had taken refuge with
      Azemilcus the king in the temple of Melkarth, which Alexander professed
      greatly to revere, and a certain number whom the Sidonians, touched at
      last with pity, concealed on board their triremes. The women, the
      children, and the slaves, to the number of thirty thousand,<a
      href="#linknote-14426" name="linknoteref-14426" id="linknoteref-14426">14426</a>
      were sold to the highest bidder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having worked his will, and struck terror, as he hoped, into the hearts of
      all who might be thinking of resisting him, Alexander concluded the Tyrian
      episode of his career by a religious ceremony.<a href="#linknote-14427"       name="linknoteref-14427" id="linknoteref-14427">14427</a> Entering the
      city from the mole in a grand procession, accompanied by his entire force
      of soldiers, fully armed and arrayed, while his fleet also played its part
      in the scene, he proceeded to the temple of Melkarth in the middle of the
      town, and offered his much desired sacrifice to Hercules. A gymnastic
      contest and a torch race formed a portion of the display. To commemorate
      his victory, he dedicated and left in the temple the battering-ram which
      had made the first impression on the southern wall, together with a Tyrian
      vessel, used in the service of the god, which he had captured when he bore
      down upon the city from Sidon with his fleet. Over the charred and
      half-ruined remnants of the city, into which he had introduced a certain
      number of colonists, chiefly Carians,<a href="#linknote-14428"       name="linknoteref-14428" id="linknoteref-14428">14428</a> he placed as
      ruler a member of a decayed branch of the royal family, a certain
      Abd-elonim, whom the Greeks called Ballonymos.<a href="#linknote-14429"       name="linknoteref-14429" id="linknoteref-14429">14429</a>

    <p>
      Phoenicia continued faithful to Alexander during the remainder of his
      career. Phoenician vessels were sent across the Ægean to the coast of the
      Peloponnese to maintain the Macedonian interest in that quarter.<a
      href="#linknote-14430" name="linknoteref-14430" id="linknoteref-14430">14430</a>
      Large numbers of the mercantile class accompanied the march of his army
      for the purposes of traffic. A portion of these, when Alexander reached
      the Hydaspes and determined to sail down the course of the Indus to the
      sea, were drafted into the vessels which he caused to be built,<a
      href="#linknote-14431" name="linknoteref-14431" id="linknoteref-14431">14431</a>
      descended the river, and accompanied Nearchus in his voyage from Patala to
      the Persian Gulf. Others still remained with the land force, and marched
      with Alexander himself across the frightful deserts of Beloochistan, where
      they collected the nard and myrrh, which were almost its only products,
      and which were produced in such abundance as to scent the entire region.<a
      href="#linknote-14432" name="linknoteref-14432" id="linknoteref-14432">14432</a>
      On Alexander&rsquo;s return to Babylon, Phoenicia was required to supply him
      with additional vessels, and readily complied with the demand. A fleet of
      forty-eight ships&mdash;two of them quinqueremes, four quadriremes, twelve
      triremes, and thirty pentaconters, or fifty-oared galleys&mdash;was
      constructed on the Phoenician coast, carried in fragments to Thapsacus on
      the Euphrates, and there put together and launched on the stream of the
      Euphrates, down which it sailed to Babylon.<a href="#linknote-14433"       name="linknoteref-14433" id="linknoteref-14433">14433</a> Seafaring men
      from Phoenicia and Syria were at the same time enlisted in considerable
      numbers, and brought to Alexander at his new capital to man the ships
      which he was building there, and also to supply colonists for the coasts
      of the Persian Gulf and the islands scattered over its surface.<a
      href="#linknote-14434" name="linknoteref-14434" id="linknoteref-14434">14434</a>
      Alexander, among his many projects, nourished an intention of adding to
      his dominions, at any rate, the seaboard of Arabia, and understood that
      for this purpose he must establish in the Persian Gulf a great naval
      power, such as Phoenicia alone out of all the countries under his dominion
      was able to furnish. His untimely death brought all these schemes to an
      end, and plunged the East into a sea of troubles.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the division of Alexander&rsquo;s empire, which followed upon his death,
      Phoenicia was at first assigned, together with Syria, to Laemedon, and the
      two formed together a separate satrapy.<a href="#linknote-14435"       name="linknoteref-14435" id="linknoteref-14435">14435</a> But, after the
      arrangement of Triparadisus (B.C. 320), Ptolemy Lagi almost immediately
      attacked Laemedon, dispossessed him of his government, and attached it to
      his own satrapy of Egypt.<a href="#linknote-14436" name="linknoteref-14436"       id="linknoteref-14436">14436</a> Six years later (B.C. 314), attacked in
      his turn by Antigonus, Ptolemy was forced to relinquish his conquests,<a
      href="#linknote-14437" name="linknoteref-14437" id="linknoteref-14437">14437</a>
      none of which offered much resistance excepting Tyre. Tyre, though no more
      than eighteen years had elapsed since its desolation by Alexander, had,
      like the fabled phoenix, risen again from its ruins, and through the
      recuperative energy of commerce had attained almost to its previous wealth
      and prosperity.<a href="#linknote-14438" name="linknoteref-14438"       id="linknoteref-14438">14438</a> Its walls had been repaired, and it was
      defended by its Egyptian garrison with pertinacity. Antigonus, who was
      master of the Phoenician mainland, established dockyards at Sidon, Byblus,
      and Tripolis, set eight thousand sawyers and labourers to cut down timber
      in Lebanon, and called upon the kings of the coast towns to build him a
      fleet with the least possible delay.<a href="#linknote-14439"       name="linknoteref-14439" id="linknoteref-14439">14439</a> His orders were
      carried out, and Tyre was blockaded by sea and land for the space of
      fifteen months, when the provisions failed and the town was forced to
      surrender itself.<a href="#linknote-14440" name="linknoteref-14440"       id="linknoteref-14440">14440</a> The garrison marched out with the honours
      of war, and Phoenicia became an appendage of the empire (for such it was)
      of Antigonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Antigonus Phoenicia passed to his son Demetrius, who maintained his
      hold on it, with some vicissitudes of fortune, till B.C. 287, when it once
      more passed under the dominion of Ptolemy Lagi.<a href="#linknote-14441"       name="linknoteref-14441" id="linknoteref-14441">14441</a> From this time
      it was an Egyptian dependency for nearly seventy years, and flourished
      commercially, if it not distinguish itself by warlike exploits. The early
      Ptolemies were mild and wise rulers. They encouraged commerce, literature,
      and art. So far as was possible they protected their dominions from
      external attack, put down brigandage, and ruled with equity and
      moderation. It was not until the fourth prince of the house of Lagus,
      Philopator, mounted the throne (B.C. 222) that the character of their rule
      changed for the worse, and their subjects began to have reason to complain
      of them. The weakness and profligacy of Philopater<a href="#linknote-14442"       name="linknoteref-14442" id="linknoteref-14442">14442</a> tempted
      Antiochus III. to assume the aggressive, and to disturb the peace which
      had now for some time subsisted between Syria and Egypt, the Lagidæ and
      the Seleucidæ. In B.C. 219 he drove the Egyptians out of Seleucia, the
      port of Antioch,<a href="#linknote-14443" name="linknoteref-14443"       id="linknoteref-14443">14443</a> and being joined by Theodotus, the
      Egyptian governor of the Coelesyrian province, invaded that country and
      Phoenicia, took possession of Tyre and Accho, which was now called
      Ptolemaïs, and threatened Egypt with subjugation.<a href="#linknote-14444"       name="linknoteref-14444" id="linknoteref-14444">14444</a> Phoenicia once
      more became the battle-field between two great powers, and for the next
      twenty years the cities were frequently taken and re-taken. At last, in
      B.C. 198, by the victory of Antiochus over Scopas,<a href="#linknote-14445"       name="linknoteref-14445" id="linknoteref-14445">14445</a> and the
      surrender of Sidon, Phoenicia passed, with Coelesyria, into the permanent
      possession of the Seleucidæ, and, though frequently reclaimed by Egypt,
      was never recovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The change of rulers was, on the whole, in consonance with the wishes and
      feelings of the Phoenicians. Though Alexandria may not have been founded
      with the definite intention of depressing Tyre, and raising up a
      commercial rival to her on the southern shore of the Mediterranean;<a
      href="#linknote-14446" name="linknoteref-14446" id="linknoteref-14446">14446</a>
      yet the advantages of the situation, and the interests of the Lagid
      princes, constituted her in a short time an actual rival, and an object of
      Phoenician jealousy. Phoenicia had been from a remote antiquity<a
      href="#linknote-14447" name="linknoteref-14447" id="linknoteref-14447">14447</a>
      down to the time of Alexander, the main, if not the sole, dispenser of
      Egyptian products to Syria, Asia Minor, and Europe. With the foundation of
      Alexandria this traffic passed out of her hands. It may be true that what
      she lost in this way was &ldquo;more than compensated by the new channels of
      eastern traffic which Alexander&rsquo;s conquests opened to her, by the security
      given to commercial intercourse by the establishment of a Greek monarchy
      in the ancient dominions of the Persian kings, and by the closer union
      which now prevailed between all parts of the civilised world."<a
      href="#linknote-14448" name="linknoteref-14448" id="linknoteref-14448">14448</a>
      But the balance of advantage and disadvantage does not even now always
      reconcile traders to a definite and tangible loss; and in the ruder times
      of which we are writing it was not to be expected that arguments of so
      refined and recondite a character should be very sensibly felt. Tyre and
      Sidon recognised in Alexandria a rival from the first, and grew more and
      more jealous of her as time went on. She monopolised the trade in Egyptian
      commodities from her foundation. In a short time she drew to herself, not
      only the direct Egyptian traffic, but that which her rulers diverted from
      other quarters, and drew to Egypt by the construction of harbours, and
      roads with stations and watering places.<a href="#linknote-14449"       name="linknoteref-14449" id="linknoteref-14449">14449</a> Much of the
      wealth that had previously flowed into Phoenicia was, in point of fact,
      diverted to Egypt, and especially to Alexandria, by the judicious
      arrangements of the earlier Lagid princes. Phoenicia, therefore, in
      attaching herself to the Seleucidæ, felt that she was avenging a wrong,
      and though materially she might not be the gainer, was gratified by the
      change in her position.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Seleucid princes on their part regarded the Phoenicians with favour,
      and made a point of conciliating their affections by personal intercourse
      with them, and by the grant of privileges. At the quinquennial festival
      instituted by Alexander ere he quitted Tyre, which was celebrated in the
      Greek fashion with gymnastic and musical contests, the Syrian kings were
      often present in person, and took part in the festivities.<a
      href="#linknote-14450" name="linknoteref-14450" id="linknoteref-14450">14450</a>
      They seem also to have visited the principal cities at other times, and to
      have held their court in them for many days together.<a
      href="#linknote-14451" name="linknoteref-14451" id="linknoteref-14451">14451</a>
      With their consent and permission, the towns severally issued their own
      coins, which bore commonly legends both in Greek and in Phoenician, and
      had sometimes Greek, sometimes Phoenician emblems.<a href="#linknote-14452"       name="linknoteref-14452" id="linknoteref-14452">14452</a> Both Aradus and
      Tyre were allowed the privilege of being asylums,<a href="#linknote-14453"       name="linknoteref-14453" id="linknoteref-14453">14453</a> from which
      political refugees could not be demanded by the sovereign.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Phoenicians in return served zealously on board the Syro-Macedonian
      fleet, and showed their masters all due respect and honour.<a
      href="#linknote-14454" name="linknoteref-14454" id="linknoteref-14454">14454</a>
      They were not afraid, however, of asserting an independence of thought and
      judgment, even in matters where the kings were personally concerned. On
      one occasion, when Antiochus Epiphanes was holding his court at Tyre, a
      cause of the greatest importance was brought before him for decision by
      the authorities at Jerusalem. The high-priest of the time, Menelaus, who
      had bought the office from the Syrian king, was accused of having
      plundered the Temple of a number of its holy vessels, and of having sold
      them for his own private advantage. The Sanhedrim, who prosecuted
      Menelaus, sent three representatives to Tyre, to conduct the case, and
      press the charges against him. The evidence was so clear that the High
      Priest saw no chance of an acquittal, except by private interest. He
      therefore bribed an influential courtier, named Ptolemy, the son of a
      certain Dorymenes, to intercede with Antiochus on his behalf, and, if
      possible, obtain his acquittal. The affair was not one of much difficulty.
      Justice was commonly bought and sold at the Syro-Macedonian Court, and
      Antiochus readily came into the views of Ptolemy, and pronounced the High
      Priest innocent. He thought, however, that in so grave a matter some one
      must be punished, and, as he had acquitted Menelaus, he could only condemn
      his accusers. These unfortunates suffered death at his hands, whereon the
      Tyrians, compassionating their fate, and to mark their sense of the
      iniquity of the sentence, decreed to give them an honourable burial. The
      historian who relates the circumstance evidently feels that it was a bold
      and courageous act, very creditable to the Tyrian people.<a
      href="#linknote-14455" name="linknoteref-14455" id="linknoteref-14455">14455</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not always, however, that we can justly praise the conduct of the
      Phoenicians at this period. Within six years of the time when the Tyrians
      showed themselves at once so courageous and so compassionate, the nation
      generally was guilty of complicity in a most unjust and iniquitous design.
      Epiphanes, having driven the Jews into rebellion by a most cruel religious
      persecution, and having more than once suffered defeat at their hands,
      resolved to revenge himself by utterly destroying the people which had
      provoked his resentment.<a href="#linknote-14456" name="linknoteref-14456"       id="linknoteref-14456">14456</a> Called away to the eastern provinces by a
      pressing need, he left instructions with his general, Lysias, to invade
      Judæa with an overwhelming force, and, after crushing all resistance, to
      sell the surviving population&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;for
      slaves. Lysias, in B.C. 165, marched into Judæa, accompanied by a large
      army, with the full intention of carrying out to the letter his master&rsquo;s
      commands. In order to attract purchasers for the multitude whom he would
      have to sell, he made proclamation that the rate of sale should be a
      talent for ninety, or less than 3l. a head,<a href="#linknote-14457"       name="linknoteref-14457" id="linknoteref-14457">14457</a> while at the
      same he invited the attendance of the merchants from all &ldquo;the cities of
      the sea-coast,&rdquo; who must have been mainly, if not wholly, Phoenicians. The
      temptation was greater than Phoenician virtue could resist. The historian
      tells us that &ldquo;the merchants of the country, hearing the fame of the
      Syrians, took silver and gold very much, with servants, and came into the
      Syrian camp to buy the children of Israel for money."<a
      href="#linknote-14458" name="linknoteref-14458" id="linknoteref-14458">14458</a>
      The result was a well-deserved disappointment. The Syrian army suffered
      complete defeat at the hands of the Jews, and had to beat a hasty retreat;
      the merchants barely escaped with their lives. As for the money which they
      had brought with them for the purchase of the captives, it fell into the
      hands of the victorious Jews, and formed no inconsiderable part of the
      booty which rewarded their valour.<a href="#linknote-14459"       name="linknoteref-14459" id="linknoteref-14459">14459</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, we hear but little of any separate action on the part of the
      Phoenicians, or of any Phoenician city, during the Seleucid period.
      Phoenicia became rapidly Hellenised; and except that they still remained
      devoted to commercial pursuits, the cities had scarcely any distinctive
      character, or anything that marked them out as belonging to a separate
      nationality. Greek legends became more frequent upon the coins; Greek
      names were more and more affected, especially by the upper classes; the
      men of letters discarded Phoenician as a literary language, and composed
      the works, whereby they sought to immortalize their names, in Greek. Greek
      philosophy was studied in the schools of Sidon;<a href="#linknote-14460"       name="linknoteref-14460" id="linknoteref-14460">14460</a> and at Byblus
      Phoenician mythology was recast upon a Greek type. At the same time
      Phoenician art conformed itself more and more closely to Greek models,
      until all that was rude in it, or archaic, or peculiar, died out, and the
      productions of Phoenician artists became mere feeble imitations of
      second-rate Greek patterns.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nation gave itself mainly to the pursuit of wealth. The old trades
      were diligently plied. Tyre retained its pre-eminence in the manufacture
      of the purple dye; and Sidon was still unrivalled in the production of
      glass. Commerce continued to enrich the merchant princes, while at the
      same time it provided a fairly lucrative employment for the mass of the
      people. A new source of profit arose from the custom, introduced by the
      Syro-Macedonians, of farming the revenue. In Phoenicia, as in Syria
      generally, the taxes of each city were let out year by year to some of the
      wealthiest men of the place,<a href="#linknote-14461"       name="linknoteref-14461" id="linknoteref-14461">14461</a> who collected
      them with extreme strictness, and made over but a small proportion of the
      amount to the Crown. Large fortunes were made in this way, though
      occasionally foreigners would step in, and outbid the Phoenician
      speculators,<a href="#linknote-14462" name="linknoteref-14462"       id="linknoteref-14462">14462</a> who were not content unless they gained
      above a hundred per cent. on each transaction. Altogether, Phoenicia may
      be pronounced to have enjoyed much material prosperity under the Seleucid
      princes, though, in the course of the civil wars between the different
      pretenders to the Crown, most of the cities had, from time to time, to
      endure sieges. Accho especially, which had received from the Lagid princes
      the name of Ptolemaïs, and was now the most important and flourishing of
      the Phoenician towns, had frequently to resist attack, and was more than
      once taken by storm.<a href="#linknote-14463" name="linknoteref-14463"       id="linknoteref-14463">14463</a>

</pre>
    <p>
      The kingdom of the Seleucidæ came to an end through its own internal
      weakness and corruption. In B.C. 83 their subjects, whether native
      Asiatics or Syro-Macedonians, were so weary of the perpetual series of
      revolts, civil wars, and assassinations that they invited Tigranes, the
      king of the neighbouring Armenia, to step in and undertake the government
      of the country.<a href="#linknote-14464" name="linknoteref-14464"       id="linknoteref-14464">14464</a> Tigranes ruled from B.C. 83 till B.C. 69,
      when he was attacked by the Romans, to whom he had given just cause of
      offence by his conduct in the Mithridatic struggle. Compelled by Lucullus
      to relinquish Syria, he retired to his own dominions, and was succeeded by
      the last Seleucid prince, Antiochus Asiaticus, who reigned from B.C. 69 to
      B.C. 65. Rome then at length came forward, and took the inheritance to
      which she had become entitled a century and a quarter earlier by the
      battle of Magnesia, and which she could have occupied at any moment during
      the interval, had it suited her purpose. The combat with Mithridates had
      forced her to become an Asiatic power; and having once overcome her
      repugnance to being entangled in Asiatic politics, she allowed her
      instinct of self-aggrandizement to have full play, and reduced the kingdom
      of the Seleucidæ into the form of a Roman province.<a
      href="#linknote-14465" name="linknoteref-14465" id="linknoteref-14465">14465</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The province, which retained the name of Syria, and was placed under a
      proconsul,<a href="#linknote-14466" name="linknoteref-14466"       id="linknoteref-14466">14466</a> whose title was &ldquo;Præses Syriæ,&rdquo; extended
      from the flanks of Amanus and Taurus to Carmel and the sources of the
      Jordan, and thus included Phoenicia. The towns, however, of Tripolis,
      Sidon, and Tyre were allowed the position of &ldquo;free cities,&rdquo; which secured
      them an independent municipal government, under their own freely elected
      council and chief magistates. These privileges, conferred by Pompey, were
      not withdrawn by Julius Cæsar, when he became master of the Roman world;
      and hence we find him addressing a communication respecting Hyrcanus to
      the &ldquo;Magistates, Council, and People of Sidon."<a href="#linknote-14467"       name="linknoteref-14467" id="linknoteref-14467">14467</a> A similar regard
      was shown for Phoenician vested rights by Anthony, who in B.C. 36, when
      his infatuation for Cleopatra was at its height, and he agreed to make
      over to her the government of Palestine and of Coelesyria, as far as the
      river Eleutherus, especially exempted from her control, despite her
      earnest entreaties, the cities of Tyre and Sidon.<a href="#linknote-14468"       name="linknoteref-14468" id="linknoteref-14468">14468</a> Anthony also
      wrote more than one letter to the &ldquo;Magistates, Council, and People of
      Tyre,&rdquo; in which he recognised them as &ldquo;allies&rdquo; of the Roman people rather
      than subjects.<a href="#linknote-14469" name="linknoteref-14469"       id="linknoteref-14469">14469</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      So far the Phoenicians would seem to have gained rather than lost by
      exchanging the dominion of Syria for that of Rome. They gained also
      greatly by the strictness with which Rome kept the police of the Eastern
      Mediterranean. For many years previously to B.C. 67 their commerce had
      been preyed upon to an enormous extent by the piratical fleets, which,
      issuing from the creeks and harbours of Western Cilicia and Pamphylia,
      spread terror on every side,<a href="#linknote-14470"       name="linknoteref-14470" id="linknoteref-14470">14470</a> and made the
      navigation of the Levant and Ægean as dangerous as it had been in the days
      anterior to Minos.<a href="#linknote-14471" name="linknoteref-14471"       id="linknoteref-14471">14471</a> Pompey, in that year, completely
      destroyed the piratical fleets, attacked the pirates in their lairs, and
      cleared them out from every spot where they had established themselves.
      Voyages by sea became once more as safe as travels by land; and a vigilant
      watch being kept on all the coasts and islands, piracy was never again
      permitted to gather strength, or become a serious evil. The Phoenician
      merchants could once more launch their trading vessels on the
      Mediterranean waters without fear of their suffering capture, and were
      able to insure their cargoes at a moderate premium.
    </p>
    <p>
      But their connection with Rome exposed the Phoenicians to some fresh, and
      terrible, perils. The great attack of Crassus on Parthia in the year B.C.
      53 had bitterly exasperated that savage and powerful kingdom, which was
      quite strong enough to retaliate, under favourable circumstances, upon the
      mighty mistress of the West, and to inflict severe sufferings upon Rome&rsquo;s
      allies, subjects, and dependencies. After a preliminary trial of strength<a
      href="#linknote-14472" name="linknoteref-14472" id="linknoteref-14472">14472</a>
      in the years B.C. 522 and 51, Pacorus, the son of Orodes, in B.C. 40,
      crossed the Euphrates in force, defeated the Romans under Decidius Saxa,
      and carried fire and sword over the whole of the Syrian presidency.<a
      href="#linknote-14473" name="linknoteref-14473" id="linknoteref-14473">14473</a>
      Having taken Apamea and Antioch, he marched into Phoenicia, ravaged the
      open country, and compelled all the towns, except Tyre, to surrender.
      Tyre, notwithstanding the mole constructed by Alexander, which joined it
      to the continent, was still regarded as impregnable, unless invested both
      by sea and land; on which account Pacorus, as he had no naval force,
      relinquished the idea of capturing it.<a href="#linknote-14474"       name="linknoteref-14474" id="linknoteref-14474">14474</a> But all the
      other cities either gave themselves up or were taken, and the conquest of
      Phoenicia being completed, the Parthian prince proceeded to occupy
      Palestine. Jerusalem fell into his hands, and for three years the entire
      tract between the Taurus range and Egypt was lost to Rome, and formed a
      portion of the Parthian Empire. What hardships, what insults, what
      outrages the Phoenicians had to endure during this interval we do not
      know, and can only conjecture; but the conduct of the Parthians at
      Jerusalem<a href="#linknote-14475" name="linknoteref-14475"       id="linknoteref-14475">14475</a> makes it probable that the inhabitants of
      the conquered districts generally had much cause for complaint. However,
      the time of endurance did not last very long; in the third year from the
      commencement of the invasion the fortune of war turned against the
      assailants. Rome, under Ventidius, recovered her lost laurels. Syria was
      reoccupied, and the Parthians driven across the Euphrates, never again to
      pass it.<a href="#linknote-14476" name="linknoteref-14476"       id="linknoteref-14476">14476</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the struggle (which soon followed these events) between Antony and
      Augustus, Phoenicia had the misfortune to give offence to the latter. The
      terms on which they stood with Antony, and the protection which he had
      afforded to their cities against the greed of Cleopatra, naturally led
      them to embrace his cause; and it should scarcely have been regarded as a
      crime in them that they did so with ardour. But Augustus, who was
      certainly not clement by nature, chose to profess himself deeply aggrieved
      by the preference which they had shown for his rival, and, when he
      personally visited the East in B.C. 20, inflicted a severe punishment on
      two at least of the cities. Dio Cassius can scarcely be mistaken when he
      says that Tyre and Sidon were &ldquo;enslaved&rdquo;&mdash;i.e. deprived of freedom&mdash;by
      Augustus,<a href="#linknote-14477" name="linknoteref-14477"       id="linknoteref-14477">14477</a> who must certainly have revoked the
      privilege originally granted by Pompey. Whether the privilege was
      afterwards restored is somewhat uncertain; but there is distinct evidence
      that more than one of the later emperors was favourably disposed to Rome&rsquo;s
      Phoenician subjects. Claudius granted to Accho the title and status of a
      Roman colony;<a href="#linknote-14478" name="linknoteref-14478"       id="linknoteref-14478">14478</a> while Hadrian allowed Tyre to call
      herself a &ldquo;metropolis."<a href="#linknote-14479" name="linknoteref-14479"       id="linknoteref-14479">14479</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Two important events have caused Tyre and Sidon to be mentioned in the New
      Testament. Jesus Christ, in the second year of his ministry, &ldquo;arose and
      went&rdquo; from Galilee &ldquo;into the borders of Tyre and Sidon,&rdquo; and there wrought
      a miracle at the earnest request of a &ldquo;Syro-Phoenician woman."<a
      href="#linknote-14480" name="linknoteref-14480" id="linknoteref-14480">14480</a>
      And Herod Agrippa, the grandson of Herod the Great, when at Cæsarea in
      A.D. 44, received an embassy from &ldquo;them of Tyre and Sidon,&rdquo; with whom he
      was highly offended, and &ldquo;made an oration&rdquo; to the ambassadors.<a
      href="#linknote-14481" name="linknoteref-14481" id="linknoteref-14481">14481</a>
      In this latter place the continued semi-independence of Tyre and Sidon
      seems to be implied. Agrippa is threatening them with war, while they
      &ldquo;desire peace.&rdquo; &ldquo;Their country&rdquo; is spoken of as if it were distinct from
      all other countries. We cannot suppose that the Judæan prince would have
      ventured to take up this attitude if the Phoenician cities had been fully
      incorporated into the Roman State, since in that case quarrelling with
      them would have been quarrelling with Rome, a step on which even Agrippa,
      with all his pride and all his rashness, would scarcely have ventured. It
      is probable, therefore, that either Tiberius or Claudius had revoked the
      decree of Augustus, and re-invested the Phoenician cities with the
      privilege whereof the first of the emperors had deprived them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after this, about A.D. 57, we have evidence that the great
      religious and social movement of the age had swept the Phoenician cities
      within its vortex, and that, in some of them at any rate, Christian
      communities had been formed, which were not ashamed openly to profess the
      new religion. The Gospel was preached in Phoenicia<a href="#linknote-14482"       name="linknoteref-14482" id="linknoteref-14482">14482</a> as early as A.D.
      41. Sixteen years later, when St. Paul, on his return from his third
      missionary journey, landed at Tyre, and proceeded thence to Ptolemaïs, he
      found at both places &ldquo;churches,&rdquo; or congregations of Christians, who
      received him kindly, ministered to his wants, prayed with him, and showed
      a warm interest in his welfare.<a href="#linknote-14483"       name="linknoteref-14483" id="linknoteref-14483">14483</a> These
      communities afterwards expanded. By the end of the second century after
      Christ Tyre was the seat of a bishopric, which held an important place
      among the Syrian Sees. Several Tyrian bishops of the second, third, and
      fourth centuries are known to us, as Cassius (ab. A.D. 198), Marinus (A.D.
      253), Methodius (A.D. 267-305), Tyrannion (A.D. 310), and Paulinus (A.D.
      328). Early in the fourth century (B.C. 335) Tyre was the seat of a synod
      or council, called to consider charges made against the great Athanasius,<a
      href="#linknote-14484" name="linknoteref-14484" id="linknoteref-14484">14484</a>
      who was taxed with cruelty, impiety, and the use of magical arts. As the
      bishops who assembled belonged chiefly to the party of Arius, the judgment
      of the council condemned Athanasius, and deprived him of his see. On
      appeal the decision was reversed; Athanasius was reinstated,<a
      href="#linknote-14485" name="linknoteref-14485" id="linknoteref-14485">14485</a>
      and advanced; the cause with which he had identified himself triumphed;
      and the Synod of Tyre being pronounced unorthodox, the Tyrian church, like
      that of Antioch, sank in the estimation of the Church at large.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tyre also made herself obnoxious to the Christian world in another way. In
      the middle of the third century she produced the celebrated philosopher,
      Porphyry,<a href="#linknote-14486" name="linknoteref-14486"       id="linknoteref-14486">14486</a> who, of all the literary opponents of
      Christianity, was the most vigorous and the most successful. Porphyry
      appears to have been a Phoenician by descent. His original name was
      Malchus&mdash;i.e. Melek or Malik, &ldquo;king.&rdquo; To disguise his Asiatic origin,
      and ingratiate himself with the literary class of the day, who were
      chiefly Greeks or Grecised Romans, he took the Hellenic and far more
      sonorous appellation of Porphyrius, which he regarded as a sort of
      synonym, since purple was the <i>royal</i> colour. He early gave himself
      to the study of philosophy, and was indefatigable in his efforts to
      acquire knowledge and learning of every kind. In Asia, probably at Tyre
      itself, he attended the lectures of Origen; at Athens he studied under
      Apollonius and Longinus; in Rome, whereto he ultimately gravitated, he
      attached himself to the Neo-Platonic school of Plotinus. His literary
      labours, which were enormous, had for their general object the
      establishment of that eclectic system which Ammonius Saccas, Plotinus,
      Jamblichus, and others had elaborated, and were endeavouring to impose
      upon the world as constituting at once true religion and true philosophy.
      He was of a constructive rather than a destructive turn of mind. Still, he
      thought it of great importance, and a necessity of the times, that he
      should write a book against the Christians, whose opinions were, he knew,
      making such progress as raised the suspicion that they would prevail over
      all others, and in a short time become universal. This polemical treatise
      ran to fifteen books, and &ldquo;exhibited considerable acquaintance with both
      the Jewish and the Christian scriptures."<a href="#linknote-14487"       name="linknoteref-14487" id="linknoteref-14487">14487</a> It is now lost,
      but its general character is well known from the works of Eusebius,
      Jerome, and others. The style was caustic and trenchant. An endeavour was
      made to show that both the historical scriptures of the Old Testament and
      the Gospels and Acts in the New were full of discrepancies and
      contradictions. The history and antiquities of the Jews, as put forth in
      the Bible, were examined, and declared to be unworthy of credit. A special
      attack was made on the genuineness and authenticity of the book of Daniel,
      which was pronounced to be the work of a contemporary of Antiochus
      Epiphanes, who succeeded in palming off upon his countrymen his own crude
      production as the work of the venerated sage and prophet. Prevalent modes
      of interpreting scripture were passed under review, and the allegorical
      exegesis of Origen was handled with especial severity. The work is said to
      have produced a vast effect, especially among the upper classes, whose
      conversion to Christianity it tended greatly to check and hinder. Answers
      to the book, or to particular portions of it, were published by Eusebius
      of Cæsarea, by Apollinaris, and by Methodius, Bishop of Tyre; but these
      writers had neither the learning nor the genius of their opponent, and did
      little to counteract the influence of his work on the upper grades of
      society.<a href="#linknote-14488" name="linknoteref-14488"       id="linknoteref-14488">14488</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The literary importance of the Phoenician cities under the Romans is
      altogether remarkable. Under Augustus and Tiberius&mdash;especially from
      about B.C. 40 to A.D. 20&mdash;Sidon was the seat of a philosophical
      school, in which the works of Aristotle were studied and explained,<a
      href="#linknote-14489" name="linknoteref-14489" id="linknoteref-14489">14489</a>
      perhaps to some extent criticised.<a href="#linknote-14490"       name="linknoteref-14490" id="linknoteref-14490">14490</a> Strabo attended
      this school for a time in conjunction with two other students, named
      Boëthus and Diodotus. Tyre had even previously produced the philosophers,
      Antipater, who was intimate with the younger Cato, and Apollonius, who
      wrote a work about Zeno, and formed a descriptive catalogue of the authors
      who had composed books on the subject of the philosophy of the Stoics.<a
      href="#linknote-14491" name="linknoteref-14491" id="linknoteref-14491">14491</a>
      Strabo goes so far as to say that philosophy in all its various aspects
      might in his day be better studied at Tyre and Sidon than anywhere else.<a
      href="#linknote-14492" name="linknoteref-14492" id="linknoteref-14492">14492</a>
      A little later we find Byblus producing the semi-religious historian,
      Philo, who professed to reveal to the Greeks the secrets of the ancient
      Phoenician mythology, and who, whatever we may think of his judgment, was
      certainly a man of considerable learning. He was followed by his pupil,
      Hermippus, who was contemporary with Trajan and Hadrian, and obtained some
      reputation as a critic and grammarian.<a href="#linknote-14493"       name="linknoteref-14493" id="linknoteref-14493">14493</a> About the same
      time flourished Marinus, the writer on geography, who was a Tyrian by
      birth, and &ldquo;the first author who substituted maps, mathematically
      constructed according to latitude and longitude, for the itinerary charts&rdquo;
       of his predecessors.<a href="#linknote-14494" name="linknoteref-14494"       id="linknoteref-14494">14494</a> Ptolemy of Pelusium based his great work
      entirely upon that of Marinus, who is believed to have utilised the
      geographical and hydrographical accumulations of the old Phoenician
      navigators, besides availing himself of the observations of Hipparchus,
      and of the accounts given of their travels by various Greek and Roman
      authors. Contemporary with Marinus was Paulus, a native of Tyre, who was
      noted as a rhetorician, and deputed by his city to go as their
      representative to Rome and plead the cause of the Tyrians before Hadrian.<a
      href="#linknote-14495" name="linknoteref-14495" id="linknoteref-14495">14495</a>
      A little later we hear of Maximus, who flourished under Marcus Aurelius
      and Commodus (ab. A.D. 160-190), a Tyrian, like Paulus, and a rhetorician
      and Platonic philosopher.<a href="#linknote-14496" name="linknoteref-14496"       id="linknoteref-14496">14496</a> The literary glories of Tyre culminated
      and terminated with Porphyry, of whose works we have already given an
      account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the middle of the third century after Christ a school of law and
      jurisprudence arose at Berytus, which attained high distinction, and is
      said by Gibbon<a href="#linknote-14497" name="linknoteref-14497"       id="linknoteref-14497">14497</a> to have furnished the eastern provinces
      of the empire with pleaders and magistrates for the space of three
      centuries (A.D. 250-550). The course of education at Berytus lasted five
      years, and included Roman Law in all its various forms, the works of
      Papinian being especially studied in the earlier times, and the same
      together with the edicts of Justinian in the later.<a
      href="#linknote-14498" name="linknoteref-14498" id="linknoteref-14498">14498</a>
      Pleaders were forced to study either at Berytus, or at Rome, or at
      Constantinople,<a href="#linknote-14499" name="linknoteref-14499"       id="linknoteref-14499">14499</a> and, the honours and emoluments of the
      profession being large, the supply of students was abundant and perpetual.
      External misfortune, and not internal decay, at last destroyed the school,
      the town of Berytus being completely demolished by an earthquake in the
      year A.D. 551. The school was then transferred to Sidon, but appears to
      have languished on its transplantation to a new soil and never to have
      recovered its pristine vigour or vitality.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is difficult to decide how far these literary glories of the Phoenician
      cities reflect any credit on the Phoenician race. Such a number of Greeks
      settled in Syria and Phoenicia under the Seleucidæ that to be a Tyrian or
      a Sidonian in the Græco-Roman period furnished no evidence at all of a man
      having any Phoenician blood in his veins. It will have been observed that
      the names of the Tyrian, Sidonian, and Berytian learned men and authors of
      the time&mdash;Antipater, Apollonius, Boëthus, Diodotus, Philo, Hermippus,
      Marinus, Paulus, Maximus, Porphyrius&mdash;are without exception either
      Latin or Greek. The language in which the books were written was
      universally Greek, and in only one or two cases is there reason to suppose
      that the authors had any knowledge of the Phoenician tongue. The students
      at Berytus between A.D. 250 and 550 were probably, in ninety-nine cases
      out of a hundred, Greeks or Romans. Phoenician nationality had, in fact,
      almost wholly disappeared in the Seleucid period. The old language ceased
      to be spoken, and though for some time retained upon the coins together
      with a Greek legend,<a href="#linknote-14500" name="linknoteref-14500"       id="linknoteref-14500">14500</a> became less frequent as time went on, and
      soon after the Christian era disappeared altogether. It is probable that,
      as a spoken language, Phoenician had gone out of use even earlier.<a
      href="#linknote-14501" name="linknoteref-14501" id="linknoteref-14501">14501</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In two respects only did the old national spirit survive, and give
      indication that, even in the nation&rsquo;s &ldquo;ashes,&rdquo; there still lived some
      remnant of its &ldquo;wonted fires.&rdquo; Tyre and Sidon were great commercial
      centres down to the time of the Crusades, and quite as rich, quite as
      important, quite as flourishing, commercially, as in the old days of Hiram
      and Ithobal. Mela<a href="#linknote-14502" name="linknoteref-14502"       id="linknoteref-14502">14502</a> speaks of Sidon in the second century
      after Christ as &ldquo;still opulent.&rdquo; Ulpian,<a href="#linknote-14503"       name="linknoteref-14503" id="linknoteref-14503">14503</a> himself a Tyrian
      by descent, calls Tyre in the reign of Septimus Severus &ldquo;a most splendid
      colony.&rdquo; A writer of the age of Constantine says of it: &ldquo;The prosperity of
      Tyre is extraordinary. There is no state in the whole of the East which
      excels it in the amount of its business. Its merchants are persons of
      great wealth, and there is no port where they do not exercise considerable
      influence."<a href="#linknote-14504" name="linknoteref-14504"       id="linknoteref-14504">14504</a> St. Jerome, towards the end of the fourth
      century, speaks of Tyre as &ldquo;the noblest and most beautiful of all the
      cities of Phoenicia,"<a href="#linknote-14505" name="linknoteref-14505"       id="linknoteref-14505">14505</a> and as &ldquo;an emporium for the commerce of
      almost the whole world."<a href="#linknote-14506" name="linknoteref-14506"       id="linknoteref-14506">14506</a> During the period of the Crusades, &ldquo;Tyre
      retained its ancient pre-eminence among the cities of the Syrian coast,
      and excited the admiration of the warriors of Europe by its capacious
      harbours, its wall, triple towards the land and double towards the sea,
      its still active commerce, and the beauty and fertility of the opposite
      shore.&rdquo; The manufactures of purple and of glass were still carried on.
      Tyre was not reduced to insignificance until the Saracenic conquest
      towards the close of the thirteenth century of our era, when its trade
      collapsed, and it became &ldquo;a rock for fishermen to spread their nets upon."<a
      href="#linknote-14507" name="linknoteref-14507" id="linknoteref-14507">14507</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The other respect in which the vitality of the old national spirit
      displayed itself was in the continuance of the ancient religion. While
      Christianity was adopted very generally by the more civilised of the
      inhabitants, and especially by those who occupied the towns, there were
      shrines and fanes in the remote districts, and particularly in the less
      accessible parts of Lebanon, where the old rites were still in force, and
      the old orgies continued to be carried on, just as in ancient times, down
      to the reign of Constantine. The account of the licentious worship of
      Ashtoreth at Aphaca, which has been already quoted from Eusebius, belongs
      to the fourth century after our era, and shows the tenacity with which a
      section of the Phoenicians, not withstanding their Hellenisation in
      language, in literature, and in art, clung to the old barbarous and awful
      cult, which had come down to them by tradition from their fathers. A
      similar worship at the same time maintained itself on the other side of
      the Lebanon chain in Heliopolis, or Baalbek, where the votaries of

      Constantine exerted himself to put down and crush out these iniquities,
      but it is more than probable that, in the secret recesses of the mountain
      region, whither government officials would find it hard to penetrate, the
      shameful and degrading rites still found a refuge, rooted as they were in
      the depraved affections of the common people, to a much later period.

      The mission of the Phoenicians, as a people, was accomplished before the
      subjection to Rome began. Under the Romans they were still ingenious,
      industrious, intelligent. But in the earlier times they were far more than
      this. They were the great pioneers of civilisation. Intrepid, inventive,
      enterprising, they at once made vast progress in the arts themselves, and
      carried their knowledge, their active habits, and their commercial
      instincts into the remotest regions of the old continent. They exercised a
      stimulating, refining, and civilising influence wherever they went. North
      and south and east and west they adventured themselves amid perils of all
      kinds, actuated by the love of adventure more than by the thirst for gain,
      conferring benefits, spreading knowledge, suggesting, encouraging, and
      developing trade, turning men from the barbarous and unprofitable pursuits
      of war and bloodshed to the peaceful occupations of productive industry.
      They did not aim at conquest. They united the various races of men by the
      friendly links of mutual advantage and mutual dependence, conciliated
      them, softened them, humanised them. While, among the nations of the earth
      generally, brute force was worshipped as the true source of power and the
      only basis of national repute, the Phoenicians succeeded in proving that
      as much could be done by arts as by arms, as great glory and reputation
      gained, as real a power built up, by the quiet agencies of exploration,
      trade, and commerce, as by the violent and brutal methods of war,
      massacre, and ravage. They were the first to set this example. If the
      history of the world since their time has not been wholly one of the
      potency in human affairs of &ldquo;blood and iron,&rdquo; it is very much owing to
      them. They, and their kinsmen of Carthage, showed mankind what a power
      might be wielded by commercial states. The lesson has not been altogether
      neglected in the past. May the writer be pardoned if, in the last words of
      what is probably his last historical work, he expresses a hope that, in
      the future, the nations of the earth will more and more take the lesson to
      heart, and vie with each other in the arts which made Phoenicia great,
      rather than in those which exalted Rome, her oppressor and destroyer?

      doubted that Phoenicia contained anciently two other land animals of
      considerable importance, viz. the lion and the deer. Lions, which were
      common in the hills of Palestine (1 Sam. xvii. 34; 1 Kings xiii. 24; xx.
      36; 2 Kings xvii. 25, 26) and frequented also the Philistine plain (Judg.
      xiv. 5), would certainly not have neglected the lowland of Sharon, which
      was in all respects suited for their habits. Deer, which still inhabit
      Galilee (Tristram, <i>Land of the Israel</i>, pp. 418, 447), are likely,
      before the forests of Lebanon were so greatly curtailed, to have occupied
      most portions of it (See Cant. ii. 9, 17; viii. 14). To these two Canon
      Tristram would add the crocodile (<i>Land of Israel</i>, p. 103), which he
      thinks must have been found in the Zerka for that river to have been
      called &ldquo;the Crocodile River&rdquo; by the Greeks, and which he is inclined to
      regard as still a denizen of the Zerka marshes. But most critics have
      supposed that the animal from which the Zerka got its ancient name was
      rather some large species of monitor.]

      which the foreign origin is, at any rate, &ldquo;not proven.&rdquo; Among the deities

      equivalent of the Egyptian Typhon, but probably a god of Phoenician origin
      (Ex. xiv. 2); 2. Sad or Tsad, sometimes apparently called Tsadam; 3. Sakon
      or Askun, a name which forms perhaps the first element in Sanchon-iathon
      (= Sakon-yithan); 4. Elat, a goddess, a female form of El, perhaps
      equivalent to the Arabian Alitta (Herod. i. 131) or Alilat (ibid. iii. 8);
      5. &lsquo;Aziz, a god who was perhaps common to the Phoenicians with the
      Syrians, since Azizus is said to have been &ldquo;the Syrian Mars;&rdquo; and 6. Pa&rsquo;am
      {...}, a god otherwise unknown. (See the <i>Corpus Inscr. Semit.</i> i.

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
